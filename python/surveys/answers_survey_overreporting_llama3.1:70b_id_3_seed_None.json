The potential short-term perception issue of a lower stock price is outweighed by the long-term benefits of accurate financial representation. Additionally, adopting an unbiased policy reduces the risk of future regulatory issues and litigation. This change aligns with higher ethical standards, which can enhance the company's reputation and foster trust among investors.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means providing complete and reliable information that reflects the company's true financial performance, without any manipulation or omission of facts. Additionally, an ethical policy should prioritize fairness and consistency in its application, avoiding any actions that may mislead or deceive stakeholders. In the context of public companies like ABC, considerations such as regulatory compliance and stakeholder trust are also essential. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy should promote accountability, integrity, and responsible decision-making.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. Firstly, how do they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and stakeholders? Secondly, what is the expected timeline for implementing the new policy, and are there any potential risks or challenges associated with it?
