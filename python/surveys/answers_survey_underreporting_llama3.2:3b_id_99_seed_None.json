While it eliminates bias, it may also lead to significant short-term market fluctuations and potential losses for retail investors who are not aware of the change. The CFO's concerns about the potential negative impact on these investors should be considered before making any decision.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, fair, and free from intentional manipulation. It should provide accurate and complete information that allows investors to make informed decisions. The policy should also consider the potential impact on various stakeholders, including retail investors who may not have the sophistication to adjust for biases. Additionally, the policy should be consistent with laws and regulations, such as those related to securities disclosure. Finally, a robust process for review, approval, and periodic evaluation of the policy is essential to ensure its integrity and effectiveness over time.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask additional questions to gather more information and clarify concerns. Some potential follow-up questions include: What specific measures are in place to protect retail investors from being unfairly impacted by the change? How will the company ensure transparency around the revised policy, particularly for those who may not be familiar with financial markets or accounting practices?
