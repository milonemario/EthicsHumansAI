This could lead to liquidity issues and decreased investor satisfaction.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, honest, and fair. It should provide clear and accurate information about a company's financial performance without exploiting investor trust or misunderstanding. The policy should disclose material information in a timely manner, avoid material tailoring to manipulate investors' perceptions, and ensure that investments decisions are made on informed rather than biased assumptions. Additionally, the policy should be communicated effectively to all stakeholders, including retail and institutional investors, to facilitate consistent understanding and interpretation of financial reports.", "e6": "No questions", "e7": "Follow", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Siding Spring)", "q10": "B"}
