While an unbiased EPS is ideal, there's significant risk involved in suddenly revealing potential inaccuracies. A market correction could hurt ABC even more than current practices with long-term consequences as the stock price recovers from such shifts. It's crucial to consider legal ramifications and investor relations risks before implementing this change. We need a measured strategy that maintains transparency and avoids negative market fallout.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes full transparency and accuracy in financial reporting. It acknowledges real underlying conditions while presenting a balanced picture of performance, even if it means sometimes presenting less rosy-looking estimates for the near term. A clear communication strategy for long-term outlook that lays out clear goals with realistic expectations helps build trust from all parties involved. Long-term stability is vital, as investors should be cautious during turbulent economic periods.", "e6": "Yes. I would have questions for management about their contingency plan if investors react negatively to the upcoming policy change or a possible market correction with current and/or future investments in mind.
