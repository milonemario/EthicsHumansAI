Additionally, all investors should be treated fairly when it comes to access to accurate information about the company's performance.", "e6": "While I appreciate the CFO's concern for the investors, it is essential to prioritize transparency and ethical practices. To mitigate potential concerns about the change in policy, management should provide clear communication explaining the updated financial reporting practices, emphasizing honesty, and ensuring fairness among all investors.
