By being upfront about the 50-cent bias, investors are not misled into thinking that earnings reporting is more accurate than it actually is. In contrast, the new policy may inadvertently create a false narrative of unbiased earnings reporting, which could harm small, retail investors who rely on this information to make informed decisions. This could lead to market volatility and unintended consequences, making the current policy a relatively safer choice.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should provide clear disclosure of any biases or adjustments made to ensure accuracy, without misleading or deceiving investors. Additionally, a fair reporting policy should take into account the potential impact on different stakeholder groups, such as retail investors, institutional investors, and market participants. Considerations like accountability, regulatory compliance, and long-term sustainability are also essential. Furthermore, a balanced approach that respects both investor expectations and financial disclosure requirements is crucial in maintaining trust and credibility in financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (PANSTARRS)", "q10": "B"}
