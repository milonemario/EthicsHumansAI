Although the initial market reaction might be negative, transparent reporting ultimately benefits the company's reputation and fosters a more sustainable investment strategy.  The risk of harming retail investors under the old policy is also a major concern.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness.  It presents a complete and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding manipulation or misleading information.  It should also consider the potential impact on all investor classes, ensuring no group is unfairly disadvantaged due to information asymmetry or deliberate obfuscation.  Consistency over time is crucial to building trust.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific methods used to bias earnings under the old policy,  a detailed analysis of the potential short-term market impact of switching to the new policy, and a plan to communicate the policy change effectively to investors, emphasizing the long-term benefits of transparency.
