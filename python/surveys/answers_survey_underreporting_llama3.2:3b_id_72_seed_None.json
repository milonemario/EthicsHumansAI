Sophisticated hedge funds may still capture the advantage of adjusting for the historical bias, potentially leading to an uneven playing field among investors. Further consideration of alternatives that address investor expectations without exacerbating the issue would be necessary before making a decision to change the policy.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and free from material biases that distort the portrayal of a company's true financial performance. It should also consider the needs of all stakeholders, including retail investors who may not possess the same level of sophistication as institutional investors. Additionally, any policy should be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and regulatory requirements, such as those set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This approach ensures that financial statements provide a fair and accurate picture of a company's financial health.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask to clarify the CFO's concerns about raising new equity and the potential impact on retail investors. I would also like to explore alternative solutions that could address these concerns while maintaining transparency and consistency in financial reporting.
