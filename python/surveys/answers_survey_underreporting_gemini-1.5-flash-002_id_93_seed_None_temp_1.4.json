Maintaining a biased reporting system, even if understood by some, is ultimately dishonest and undermines investor trust.  Switching to the new policy is a necessary step towards building credibility and long-term value.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness to all investors.  It avoids any intentional manipulation or bias in presenting financial results.  Consistency in application of accounting standards and clear communication of policies are also vital.  It must also consider potential impact on different investor groups (e.g., retail vs. institutional) and strive to prevent any unfair advantage stemming from information asymmetry.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific communication plan to inform investors about the change in policy, aiming to mitigate the predicted negative short-term market reaction. I'd also inquire about strategies to level the playing field for retail investors, ensuring they are not unduly disadvantaged by the shift in reporting practices.  Finally, I'd want to understand how management would proactively address any potential investor confusion or misinterpretations following the policy change.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
