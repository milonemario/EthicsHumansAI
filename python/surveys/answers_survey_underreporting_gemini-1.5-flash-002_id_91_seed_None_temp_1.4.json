The current policy, even if understood by sophisticated investors, is inherently deceptive.  The new policy fosters trust and long-term stability, even if it involves some initial market adjustment.  The potential for unfair advantage to sophisticated investors under the current policy outweighs any temporary negative market sentiment under the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids deliberate manipulation or bias, presenting a fair and complete picture of the company's financial performance.  It also considers the potential impact on all investor groups, striving for equal access to information and avoiding situations that create an unfair advantage for some over others.  Materiality and the potential for misleading investors should also be considered.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific mechanisms used to bias the earnings reports, the projected impact of the policy change on investor relations, and a detailed plan for communicating the change transparently to all investors, including retail investors, to mitigate any potential misunderstanding or negative market impact.
