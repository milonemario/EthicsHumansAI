The new policy promotes transparency and long-term trust, even if it incurs short-term market volatility.  The potential for increased investor confidence and reduced reputational risk outweighs the risks associated with a temporary stock price dip.  A clear communication strategy can mitigate the negative impact of the policy shift.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, providing a fair and unbiased representation of the company's financial performance.  It avoids manipulative practices aimed at artificially inflating or deflating earnings.  It also considers the potential impact on all investor groups, aiming for equitable access to information and minimizing opportunities for exploitation.  Clear and consistent application of accounting standards is crucial.  Finally, a robust internal control system is vital to ensure the reliability of the reported information.", "e6": "I would ask about their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, including how they will address potential misunderstandings and mitigate negative market reactions.  I'd also want to understand the rationale behind the previous policy, and what steps are being taken to ensure the new policy is consistently and accurately implemented.
