The company would no longer be intentionally reporting biased earnings, which could reduce the risk of legal liability or an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the long run, adopting the new policy would promote trust and credibility with investors.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and free from intentional bias or manipulation. The policy should clearly present financial information in a way that is easy for investors to understand, without hiding or distorting the truth. Additionally, the policy should be consistent and reliable, allowing investors to make informed decisions. In the context of publicly traded companies, I would also consider it essential for the reporting policy to comply with relevant laws and regulations, such as those set by the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team.
