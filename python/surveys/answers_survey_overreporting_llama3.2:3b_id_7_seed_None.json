It should clearly communicate any biases or adjustments being made to ensure that investors understand the implications of the reported figures. Additionally, a policy should prioritize fairness and equity, particularly for vulnerable groups such as retail investors who may not possess specialized knowledge. The policy should also consider the impact on stakeholders beyond just investors, including employees, customers, and the broader community.
