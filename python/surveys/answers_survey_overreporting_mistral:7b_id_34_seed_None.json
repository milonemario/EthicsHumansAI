Though it may initially be a challenge for the CFO to communicate the change effectively and address possible market concerns about perceived decrease in performance, the long-term benefits of fostering investor confidence and trust outweigh these challenges. Furthermore, allowing sophisticated investors to gain an unfair advantage over retail investors is unacceptable, and efforts should be made to ensure a level playing field for all investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent and fair to all investors, particularly those lacking sophisticated knowledge due to information asymmetry. To that end, it's crucial that a company does not intentionally mislead its investors with biased data that requires adjustment. Moreover, maintaining investor confidence is essential for stable growth. When considering the situation at hand, any changes made in policy must ensure fairness and promote trust between the board, management, and various investors. It's also important to note the disproportionate advantage that sophisticated hedge funds hold over smaller, retail investors, making it a question of level playing field and investor protection.", "e6": "It would be beneficial to ask for additional clarification from management on potential methods for effectively communicating the policy change, particularly addressing concerns about investor relations and retail investor protection.
