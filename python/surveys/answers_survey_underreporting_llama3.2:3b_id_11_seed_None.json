This could ultimately result in lower stock prices and reduced investment. On the other hand, the long-term financial benefits of increased transparency and credibility may outweigh these short-term drawbacks. As a board member, I would need to carefully weigh these factors before making a final decision, potentially considering alternative solutions or measures to mitigate potential risks.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and consistency. It should avoid misleading or deceiving investors, while also providing enough information to enable informed decision-making. In the context of a earnings reporting policy, this means clearly disclosing any biases or adjustments made to reported results, and ensuring that these disclosures are accurately reflected in financial statements and public communications. The policy should also consider the potential impact on different stakeholders, including retail investors who may be most vulnerable to market fluctuations.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about specific risks and mitigation strategies associated with the new policy, such as how changes in earnings reporting will be communicated to investors, and what processes are in place to ensure accuracy and consistency in financial reporting.
