On one hand, investors might appreciate the honesty; on the other, they may initially react negatively due to market conditions or their initial expectations. Weighing these competing factors makes a definitive recommendation challenging.", "e5": "In an ideal scenario, I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it provides accurate and unbiased information to stakeholders. This would involve being truthful about the company's performance, without any intentional omissions or manipulations. Transparency is also crucial, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on complete data. Furthermore, the policy should be applied consistently and fairly, ensuring that no groups are unfairly disadvantaged. In this context, I consider fairness to be particularly important, as a bias in financial reporting can have far-reaching consequences for various stakeholders, including retail investors who may be disproportionately affected.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask how they plan to mitigate potential short-term financial consequences, such as stock price fluctuations or lawsuits from shareholders who feel misled by the current policy. Additionally, I'd like to know if there's a strategy for ensuring employees and other stakeholders understand the new policy and its implications.
