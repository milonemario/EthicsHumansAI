Adopting the new policy, while potentially causing temporary stock price dips, establishes long-term trust and transparency, which are ultimately more valuable than short-term gains.  The risk of sophisticated investors exploiting less informed investors is a separate issue requiring mitigation strategies, not a reason to maintain deceptive practices.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and unbiased.  It presents a fair and complete picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any intentional misrepresentation or manipulation.  It also considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors of varying sophistication, and aims for fair and equitable treatment.  Consistency over time in reporting methods is crucial to avoid suspicion.", "e6": "I'd ask about specific strategies to mitigate the potential negative market reaction to the new policy, such as a proactive investor relations campaign explaining the change and its benefits.
