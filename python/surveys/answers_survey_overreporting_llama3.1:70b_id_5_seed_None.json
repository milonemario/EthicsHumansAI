Although some investors may initially react negatively due to a lack of understanding about the change, ultimately, it will lead to more accurate market valuations. Additionally, adopting unbiased reporting reduces the risk of regulatory issues and reputational damage. The long-term benefits of increased credibility and fairness outweigh potential short-term market volatility.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and easily understandable by all stakeholders. The policy should be designed to provide a true representation of the company's financial performance, without attempting to mislead or manipulate investors. Considerations such as regulatory compliance, avoiding harm to vulnerable groups (e.g., retail investors), and long-term sustainability are also important. Furthermore, the reporting process should be reliable, consistent, and subject to regular review and audit to ensure its integrity. This approach promotes trust, fairness, and informed decision-making in the capital markets.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask: What steps will be taken to ensure that all stakeholders, including retail investors and analysts, are properly informed about the change in reporting policy?
