Although sophisticated hedge funds would understand the change, small investors might be caught off guard by a sudden shift in reported earnings. Before making a decision, I would recommend disclosing the reason for the change and providing guidance on how to adjust for the bias, ensuring that all investors can make informed decisions about their investments.", "e5": "A reporting policy is viewed as ethical when it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should avoid misleading or hiding information, which can lead to undue risk for investors. A policy that allows for adjustments based on a known bias, as in the current situation, demonstrates a commitment to truthfulness. Additionally, it is essential to consider the potential impact of changes on different investor groups, particularly those who may be less familiar with such nuances, and ensure that they can make informed decisions about their investments.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more details on their plan to address the potential impact on retail investors and to offer suggestions for how they would mitigate any negative effects of the change in policy. Additionally, I would like to inquire about the process for communicating this change to investors ahead of time and how transparency will be maintained throughout the transition.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Siding Spring)", "q10": "B"}
