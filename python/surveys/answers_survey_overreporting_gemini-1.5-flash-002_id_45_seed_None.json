The new policy, despite potential for initial market reaction, fosters trust and long-term credibility.  This is vital for attracting investors who value ethical practices and sustainable growth.  The short-term risk is less significant than the long-term damage of continued deceptive practices.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should present a fair and complete picture of the company's financial performance without manipulation or deliberate obfuscation.  It also needs to consider the potential impact on different stakeholder groups (investors, employees, customers) and strive for fairness in its disclosure practices.  Transparency should be balanced with legal and competitive requirements;  however, ethical considerations should always be paramount.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market impact of switching to the unbiased reporting policy.  I'd also want to understand their plan to communicate the change clearly and proactively to investors, mitigating any misunderstanding. Finally, I would inquire about their risk assessment for the current policy and explore alternative approaches to manage investor expectations without resorting to manipulation.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
