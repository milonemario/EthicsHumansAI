Changing to the new policy, though potentially leading to short-term market fluctuations, demonstrates a commitment to transparency and truthful reporting, which is crucial for long-term investor confidence and the company's reputation.

It avoids misleading investors through manipulation or undisclosed biases.  Context matters;  a policy should be understandable and avoid complexity that could be exploited for unethical gain.  The policy should also consider investor sophistication levels, aiming for fair treatment for all stakeholders, while acknowledging that perfect alignment may be challenging.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about the specific methods used for biasing the current reporting,  the anticipated impact of the policy change on short-term market reaction,  a detailed financial impact assessment of the new policy, and the company's plan for communicating the policy change transparently to all investors, including steps to address concerns from less sophisticated investors, to ensure all investors understand and respond appropriately.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
