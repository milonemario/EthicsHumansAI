It is thus recommended that ABC adopt truthful financial reporting practices, making clear communication about any changes, and demonstrating transparency.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, completeness and reliability. It is essential to avoid bias or manipulation in the reported financial figures to safeguard investors' confidence in the company and maintain a fair market equilibrium. Although maintaining the longstanding earnings biased policy might foster investor certainty and mitigate negative surprise risk in the short run, a future alteration may expose ABC to potential reputational harm and regulatory investigations given the mounting legal threats. It would then be beneficial for ABC to align ethical concerns with its financial reporting strategy, which implies making clear changes to policies and procedures while prioritizing communication, thereby leveling the playing field across all investors. Such decisions would ultimately strengthen ABC's integrity and sustainability over periods of time.", "e6": "To clarify the implications on long-term stability for the investors in the eventuality of changing financial report practices: What evidence backs up the claim that small retail investors will bear the brunt of the 'punishment' after a period of lower performance due to higher underreported earnings?
