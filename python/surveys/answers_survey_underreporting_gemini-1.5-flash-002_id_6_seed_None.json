Switching to the new, unbiased policy promotes transparency and long-term trust with investors.

Consistency and adherence to accepted accounting practices are also crucial for maintaining trust and credibility.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the policy change to investors.
