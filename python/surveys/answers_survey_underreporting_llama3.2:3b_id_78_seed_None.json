Most investors are aware of the 50-cent bias and adjust their expectations accordingly. Changing to an unbiased policy without considering how this might affect smaller investors could have unintended consequences. Instead, I recommend exploring alternative solutions, such as educating retail investors about the changed policy or finding other ways to balance the need for transparency with the potential impact on smaller investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should avoid biases that distort financial information and create unrealistic expectations. Considerations such as stakeholder impact, simplicity, and consistency are also important. In this context, the current policy's 50-cent bias towards lower earnings may be ethically debatable as it assumes investors' cognitive abilities to adjust for this discrepancy. A policy without bias would promote trust and credibility with investors, particularly retail ones who may rely on reported earnings to make informed decisions.", "e6": "Yes. Specifically, I would ask about any data or insights indicating that retail investors are affected by the current policy and how the management team plans to mitigate potential negative impacts, such as altering investor education initiatives or developing more targeted communication strategies to ensure smaller investors remain informed.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "2011 CQ21, a near-Earth asteroid discovered on January 11, 2013, but later reclassified as an interstellar object on December 17, 2020.", "q10": "B"}
