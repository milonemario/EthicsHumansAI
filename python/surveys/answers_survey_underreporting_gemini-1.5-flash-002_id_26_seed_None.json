It should present a complete and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any manipulation or deliberate misrepresentation.

Consideration should also be given to the potential impact on all investor groups, preventing exploitation of less sophisticated investors.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the policy change to investors and mitigate any negative short-term market reactions.
