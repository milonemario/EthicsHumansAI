Although there's a risk of short-term market reaction, the long-term benefits of transparency and building a strong reputation based on integrity far outweigh the potential for temporary stock price fluctuations.

It considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the wider community, ensuring equitable access to information.  Consistency and adherence to accepted accounting principles are also crucial aspects of ethical reporting.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to detail their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, outlining how they will manage investor expectations and address potential concerns about the initial market reaction.
