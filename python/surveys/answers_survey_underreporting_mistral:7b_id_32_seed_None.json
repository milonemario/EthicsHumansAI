Although some investors understand that reported earnings should be adjusted upward by 50 cents, changing the policy would help mitigate potential legal liability or investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. While retail investors may initially be at a disadvantage due to lack of awareness about the policy change, increased disclosure and gradual introduction of accurate reporting can help alleviate this issue over time.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and consistent. In this context, it is important to avoid bias in reported earnings, even if it results in short-term market fluctuations or a temporary disadvantage for some investors.
