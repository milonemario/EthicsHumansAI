Switching to the new policy, while risky in the short-term due to potential market misunderstanding, establishes greater transparency and long-term trust.  The risk of short-term negative reactions is outweighed by the benefits of ethical reporting and building long-term investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and consistent.  It avoids intentional manipulation or bias, ensuring all stakeholders have access to a fair and complete picture of the company's financial performance.  It should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups and strive for fairness and equitable access to information, mitigating potential for information asymmetry.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the policy change to different investor groups.  I'd also want to understand a detailed risk assessment of the potential short-term market reaction, including specific mitigation strategies and contingency plans.
