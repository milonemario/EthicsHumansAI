While there may be short-term market pain from transitioning to unbiased reporting,  it ultimately builds long-term credibility and avoids potential legal risks associated with the current practice. Honesty and transparency are essential for sustainable business success.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and completeness. Reported financials should reflect the true financial position of the company without manipulation or intentional bias.  While communication strategies are important to manage market expectations, those strategies shouldn't rely on distorting underlying data. Ethical considerations also extend to clearly communicating any changes in accounting practices or policies to all stakeholders, ensuring everyone has access to the same information. Ultimately, ethical reporting builds trust and fosters a sustainable business environment.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for management.  First, what communication strategy do they propose to deploy alongside the policy change to mitigate potential market misinterpretations? Second, have they conducted any analyses on the potential short-term and long-term impact of the policy change on share price and investor sentiment? Lastly, are there any legal or regulatory concerns associated with the current biased reporting practice that could expose the company to risk?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "'Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
