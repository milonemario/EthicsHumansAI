This means that earnings and other key financial data should be consistent, transparent, and truthful in nature. Relevant considerations in this case include: upholding the trust of investors, ensuring fair dealings, avoiding legal liability, and prioritizing long-term growth for all stakeholders, particularly small retail investors who may not have access to the same financial information as more sophisticated investors.", "e6": "As a board member, I have several follow-up questions for the management team. Firstly, what evidence or data supports the claim that adjusting earnings downward by 50 cents is widely understood and accepted within the investor community? Secondly, can we estimate the potential financial impact of changing the policy on retail investors compared to sophisticated hedge funds over different time horizons? Thirdly, are there alternative approaches that address both the legal liability concerns and maintain strong stock performance while still offering a fair market environment for all investors, especially small retail investors?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "It would be unethical and potentially illegal for ABC company to continue over-reporting its earnings per share.
