It relies on a tacit agreement that undermines the integrity of financial reporting. Shifting to a new policy, regardless of short-term market volatility, demonstrates a commitment to ethical conduct and builds trust with investors in the long run. The potential for misinterpretation is outweighed by the benefits of transparency and compliance.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and completeness. It avoids any intentional manipulation or distortion of financial data, even if such practices are commonplace or understood by a segment of stakeholders.  Ethical reporting acknowledges potential complexities in interpretation but ultimately aims to provide a clear and unbiased view of the company's performance. It also considers broader societal implications and strives to build trust with all investors, including retail investors who may not have access to sophisticated financial analysis.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. First, what specific communication strategies could we employ to effectively convey the change in policy and minimize potential for misinterpretation by investors? Second, how can we proactively engage with analysts and institutional investors to address their concerns and ensure a smooth transition? Lastly, are there any concrete examples of companies that have successfully implemented similar changes and the lessons learned from their experience?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "'Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
