The new policy would address these concerns by providing unbiased financial data.", "e6": "As a board member, I would have several questions for the management team to further understand their concerns and assess the risks and benefits of the proposed policy change. I would ask about the specific costs associated with changing the policy and the potential market reaction to any communications or disclosures regarding the change in policy.
