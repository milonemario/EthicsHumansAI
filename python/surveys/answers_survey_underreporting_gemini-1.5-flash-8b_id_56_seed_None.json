Maintaining transparency and truthful reporting, even with potential short-term market adjustments, ultimately builds investor trust and confidence in the long run.  The CFO's concerns about retail investor impact are valid but can likely be mitigated through clear communication and robust investor relations efforts.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deception, even if it means potentially short-term market reactions.  Consideration must be given to the intended audience (sophisticated vs. retail investors) and whether the reporting method is genuinely and consistently applied.  Crucially, the policy should be aligned with the company's overall mission and values, and not just driven by short-term financial goals.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd want to understand the specific market analysis supporting the prediction of a 50-cent earnings adjustment by investors.  Also, what investor relations plan is in place to mitigate potential negative investor reaction to the policy change? Finally, what mechanisms are in place to ensure consistent and transparent application of the new policy across all reporting periods?
