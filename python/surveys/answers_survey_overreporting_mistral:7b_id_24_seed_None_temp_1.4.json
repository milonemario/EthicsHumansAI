The current policy creates potential legal and regulatory risks due to manipulation, despite investors adjusting earnings themselves. Transition difficulties, like diminished stock prices in the short term or an uneven knowledge base among investors, necessitate communicating the changes and mitigating harm diligently. Ultimately, maintaining strong investor trust through honest reporting overcomes these temporary challenges.", "e5": "In my view, an ethical earnings reporting policy should provide consistency and transparent information. It should accurately reflect the performance of the company in question according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); any deviation from that principle constitutes financial manipulation and exposes the firm to legal consequences or investigation by regulatory agencies. Adequate communication of changes in the reporting policy is expected, while considering the well-being of all investors. The characterization, communication, and rationalization behind earnings-biased policies favor hedge funds over retail investors \u2013 hence the principle needs immediate resolution through unbiasedly reporting the EPS.", "e6": "I would question the management\u2019s rationale behind keeping earnings biased when potential legal risks have already been identified and investors are adjusting EPS down by this amount. Is there an alternative strategy or communication method to inform shareholders effectively about the potential policy change, avoiding undue advantage to sophisticated hedge funds against retail investors?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "B", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "interstellar object", "q10": "C"}
