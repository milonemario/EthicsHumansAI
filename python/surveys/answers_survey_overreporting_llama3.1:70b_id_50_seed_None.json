Although some investors may initially misinterpret the change, the benefits of accurate reporting outweigh the potential short-term consequences. The new policy reduces the risk of legal liability and SEC investigation, and aligns with ethical business practices. It also eliminates the need for investors to make adjustments to reported earnings, making it easier for them to understand the company's true financial performance.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and honesty. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, free from bias or manipulation, to ensure stakeholders have a complete understanding of the company's financial performance. Additionally, the policy should be consistent and reliable, minimizing the risk of misinterpretation. In the context of public companies, regulatory compliance is also a crucial consideration. Furthermore, an ethical reporting policy should consider the needs of all stakeholders, including retail investors, who may not have the same level of expertise as institutional investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. Firstly, what is the estimated timeline for implementing the new policy and how will stakeholders be informed about the change? Secondly, how will management address potential short-term market volatility resulting from the policy shift? Thirdly, are there any plans to educate retail investors about the implications of the change to mitigate potential confusion? Lastly, has management considered seeking external guidance or assurance from auditors or regulatory bodies to ensure compliance and smooth implementation of the new policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1), a small, elongated, and reddish object roughly 400 meters in length, discovered on October 19, 2017, passing through our solar system at a speed of about 26 km/s.", "q10": "B"}
