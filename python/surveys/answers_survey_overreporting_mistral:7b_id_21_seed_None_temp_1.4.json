Moreover, despite investor recognition that earnings should be adjusted downward by 50 cents under bias-based reporting, it remains a deceiving and untruthful method that lacks transparency and long-term sustainability for the company. Adopting an improved policy based on credible, reliable, and transparent financial reporting is essential to maintain stakeholders' confidence and strengthen relationships with retail investors. Despite its perceived short-term challenges, an unbiased EPS would be a more responsible choice in fostering growth and corporate governance principles for the benefit of ABC in the long term.", "e5": "Given ABC's situation, an ethical reporting policy would be transparent and truthful in representing their financial performance. Adopting unbiased earnings per share (EPS) that accurately reflect their financial condition would prevent any misleading information being disseminated to investors of the wide variety of sophistication and background. Providing reliable reports promotes trust, accountability, integrity, and strengthen relationships within the investment ecosystem while fostering a long-term focus over temporary concerns associated with equity financing.", "e6": "While I accept that the investor community has implicitly adjusted for earnings biased downwards through their research processes and trades, changing financial reporting policy would promote fairness and credibility. It remains essential to assess the potential advantages larger investors might obtain to mitigate risks related to misrepresentation caused by the current method in a volatile environment. Thus I will ask management three important questions: 1) Can management explain potential legal challenges when communicating earnings through both policies?  2) Could an educational campaign or communication materials aimed at raising retail investor awareness prevent a perceived unjustified stock correction? 3) Might the change to earnings reporting without bias encourage investors to better understand long-term objectives and strategies, allowing for a stronger connection to company performance?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 3, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "It is not relevant to provide an answer for the question you provided.
