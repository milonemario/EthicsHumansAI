A negative market reaction, especially if investors misunderstand the change, could severely impact the company's stock price and harm retail investors.  A more thorough analysis of potential market impact and investor communication strategies is needed before making a recommendation to change the policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids intentional manipulation or deception, even if a perceived benefit exists for the company.  Consideration must be given to the impact on all stakeholders, including investors of different sophistication levels, and whether the policy promotes trust and fairness in the market.  A robust communication strategy to explain the change and address potential investor concerns is crucial for a truly ethical transition.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed market analysis of potential stock price reactions to both the current and new policies, including scenarios considering different investor segments (sophisticated vs. retail).  I'd also want to understand the proposed investor communication plan to mitigate potential negative impacts and ensure transparent explanation of the change in policy. Finally, I'd inquire about the potential long-term impact on investor confidence and the company's reputation in relation to the change.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
