Though CFO concerns about negative market impact could potentially harm retail investors temporarily, long-term ethical business practices, along with timely communication of the change-in-policy adjustments to current biases are key in mitigating both the impact on investors and ensuring an eventual recovery of share value.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy must be transparent, consistent, and honest. The current policy under-reports actual earnings, creating an environment with a significant potential for investor misinterpretation of financial statements. This practice is also susceptible to legal liability due to its hidden bias in the reported EPS. A reporting policy should ensure that investors have access to accurate information to make well-informed investment decisions. In this context, it is essential to avoid creating an unfair advantage for particular investors and harming small retail investors' confidence, as suggested by the CFO, as this can erode long-term investor trust and impact the overall market integrity.", "e6": "I would request clarification from management on potential mitigation scenarios to address the identified concerns raised by the CFO. Some follow-up questions to consider are: How can investor communication be improved when implementing a new no-bias policy to ensure all investors receive accurate information? What strategies will be employed to prevent large institutional investors, with inside knowledge, from exploiting smaller retail investors? Could the firm provide educational resources and financial literacy support to improve the collective investment awareness of retail investors prior to changing policies and avoid unexpected adjustments on their investments?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "I cannot answer this question, as it is not related to the context provided.", "q10": "D"}
