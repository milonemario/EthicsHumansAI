While there may be short-term market volatility and concerns about investor adjustment, the long-term benefits of increased transparency outweigh these risks. Additionally, the current policy's potential for exposure to legal liability is a significant concern that can be mitigated by adopting the new policy.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and consistency. It should clearly disclose all relevant information, without intention to mislead or deceive stakeholders. In the context of financial reporting, this means providing unbiased and unmanipulated data, avoiding practices like consistently under-reporting earnings. Furthermore, it's essential to consider the potential impact on various stakeholder groups, including retail investors who may not have the same level of sophistication as institutional investors. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy should strive to promote trust, fairness, and informed decision-making.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. What is the expected timeline for implementing the new policy? How will the company communicate the change to investors and other stakeholders?
