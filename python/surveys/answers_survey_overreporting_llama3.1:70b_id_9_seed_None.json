This is essential for building trust with investors and maintaining a strong reputation. Furthermore, transparent reporting reduces the risk of legal liability or regulatory scrutiny, which could have long-term negative consequences for the company. In contrast, continuing the biased reporting policy may create an advantage for sophisticated investors at the expense of retail investors, which raises concerns about fairness and ethics.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant financial information, without any intention to mislead or deceive stakeholders. In the context of public companies, this means presenting financial data in a way that is consistent with accounting standards and regulatory requirements. Additionally, the policy should be fair, treating all investors equally by providing them with the same level of access to financial information. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes honesty and integrity over potential short-term gains or advantages.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. For example: What specific steps will be taken to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and analysts? How will the company ensure that all stakeholders understand the reason behind the change? Are there any plans to restate prior periods' financial statements under the new policy? Additionally, I would also ask about the potential impact on investor relations, stock price, and the overall reputation of the company.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
