Although the current practice has been consistent and understood by investors, it exposes the firm to legal liability and potential investigations. Additionally, prioritizing sophisticated hedge funds over retail investors is not ethical and can harm small investors in the long run. While the CFO's concerns about communicating the change in policy are valid, developing effective investor communication plans and addressing any underlying incentives that led to the current practice will help mitigate any negative effects on the firm.", "e5": "For a reporting policy to be ethical, it should prioritize transparency, honesty, and integrity in disclosing accurate financial information. This not only ensures accountability towards stakeholders but also builds trust within the investor community. The current practice of consistently over-reporting earnings by 50 cents exposes ABC company to potential legal liability and ethical concerns due to its biased nature. A new policy with unbiased reporting that accurately reflects the firm's financial performance would be preferable, despite initial challenges in communicating and adjusting investor expectations. Additionally, it is essential to consider the impact of this decision on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be more vulnerable. Ensuring a level playing field for all investors and considering strategies that mitigate any potential negative effects on them should also be a top priority.", "e6": "To ensure a thorough understanding of the situation, the board would benefit from asking additional questions to clarify key points and address concerns raised by the management team. Here are potential follow-up questions that could be asked: 1) Can legal counsel elaborate on the possible risks associated with continued earnings bias? Are there any precedents or recent examples related to similar practices in other firms under investigation for misleading investors? 2) Is there a specific timeframe within which the new no-bias policy would be implemented, and how will the firm prepare its investor relations team to communicate this change effectively? 3) What actions has management taken to consider the potential impact on retail investors, and what measures are in place to ensure that all stakeholders have equal information and access? 4) Can the management team provide an overview of any incentives or pressures that may have influenced the prior management's decisions, as well as their current rationale for maintaining this practice?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 4, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
