It should provide clear guidelines for what information is reported and how it is presented, avoiding any practices that could be perceived as misleading or deceptive. In this context, a policy with a known bias (like the current 50-cent underreporting) requires transparency to help investors understand the difference between reported and true earnings. Any changes to such a policy should consider protecting investors from potential harm due to a lack of understanding about the revised reporting standard.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 1}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4, also known as Oumuamua, which means 'scout' or 'vanguard' in Hawaiian, was discovered on December 6, 2017, by astronomers at the University of Hawaii and the Pan-STARRS project.", "q10": "B"}
