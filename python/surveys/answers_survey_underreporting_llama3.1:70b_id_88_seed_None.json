Although some investors may initially be confused, clear communication from the company can help to educate them on the change. The benefits of unbiased reporting outweigh the potential short-term costs, as it promotes a more informed market and reduces the risk of legal liability or regulatory scrutiny.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and consistent. The policy should provide stakeholders with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the company's financial performance. Ethical considerations include ensuring that all investors have equal access to information, avoiding selective disclosure, and being mindful of potential consequences on vulnerable stakeholders, such as retail investors. Additionally, the policy should be compliant with relevant regulations and standards, and any changes to the policy should be clearly communicated to stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide a plan for how they intend to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and analysts.
