Maintaining the current policy fosters a culture of manipulation and deception, potentially leading to greater risks down the line.  The new policy, while initially causing some investor confusion, will ultimately build trust and strengthen the company's reputation.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, providing a fair and unbiased representation of the company's financial performance.  It avoids intentional manipulation or obfuscation, even if it might lead to short-term negative market reactions.  It considers the impact on all stakeholders, not just shareholders, and adheres to all relevant accounting standards and regulations.  Consistency and clarity are also key to ensuring proper understanding and preventing investor confusion.", "e6": "I'd ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the policy change and mitigate the anticipated negative market reaction.  I'd also want to understand their assessment of the potential impact on different investor groups (retail vs. institutional) and what steps will be taken to protect retail investors. Finally, I would inquire about the process for regularly reviewing and updating the company's accounting policies to ensure they remain ethical and compliant.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
