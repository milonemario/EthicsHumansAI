Consistency over time is also vital to build investor confidence.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific mechanisms used to create the 50-cent bias in the past and a detailed plan to communicate the policy change to investors, highlighting the steps taken to mitigate potential negative market reactions and educate retail investors.
