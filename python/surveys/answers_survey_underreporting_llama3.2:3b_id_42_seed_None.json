While the current policy may benefit the company in the short term, it provides a misleading representation of earnings and could lead to regulatory issues or reputational damage. The new policy would promote transparency and accuracy, potentially leading to long-term benefits. To mitigate potential negative impacts on retail investors, the company could provide clear guidance and communication about the change, helping them understand the implications and make informed decisions.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that promotes transparency, honesty, and fairness. A key characteristic is accuracy, ensuring that financial reports present a true and complete picture of the company's performance. Another essential aspect is consistency, with policies and procedures applied uniformly to avoid misleading investors or providing uneven treatment of similar items. Additionally, policymakers should consider stakeholder impact, balancing the needs of retail investors with those of sophisticated investors who can better understand the implications of changes in reporting policy. Clarity and disclosure are also critical.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask several follow-up questions to better understand the management team's reasoning and potential risks associated with changing to the new policy. Some of these questions include: What steps will be taken to educate retail investors about the change in reporting policy? How will we mitigate any short-term losses or volatility that may result from the policy change? Can you provide more detailed information on the expected benefits of the new policy and how they will be realized? Additionally, are there any other stakeholders whose interests should be considered during this decision?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 CQ21, also known as 'Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
