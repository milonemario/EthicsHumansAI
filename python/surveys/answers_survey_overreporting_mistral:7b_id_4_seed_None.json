Maintaining a consistent bias in reported earnings may expose the firm to potential legal risks and harm its long-term reputation. Although changing to the no-bias policy might initially cause stock price volatility, it aligns more closely with ethical practices and fosters transparency. In addition, addressing these concerns sooner rather than later can help mitigate unintended consequences for retail investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. In this context, continued over-reporting of earnings can expose the firm to legal risks, investor uncertainty, and unequal access to information, harming retail investors. A no-bias policy, while potentially causing short-term volatility in stock prices, upholds ethical standards by providing reliable and unbiased financial reported data across all investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would have a few follow-up questions to further clarify the situation and ensure the Board is making an informed decision:1. Has the management team explored ways to address small investor concerns while transitioning to the no-bias policy? For example, communicating effectively about the changes in reporting practices and providing educational resources on adjusting reported earnings.2. What steps have been taken to prevent uneven access of information between institutional investors (such as hedge funds) and retail investors when considering the new policy? In addition, how can we mitigate potential negative consequences for retail investors in the short term due to reduced market liquidity or an imbalance in trading opportunities?3. Can management provide any evidence that not changing the reporting policy has not resulted in legal issues or investigations during their tenure? In the event that such problems arise from continuing the current practice, what are the potential costs for ABC and its shareholders?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "", "q10": "D"}
