While acknowledging the CFO's concerns about potential investor confusion in the initial period, I recommend that the board takes a transparent and ethical approach by adopting the new policy without bias. This approach aligns with the principles of fairness and transparency, fostering trust among all investors while reducing legal risks and protecting retail investors from potential exploitation.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and fair to all investors. It should reflect accurate financial performance and disclose any material information that could impact an investor's decision-making. In this case, the current practice of underreporting earnings per share (EPS) by 50 cents is not only misleading but can potentially lead to legal liability or investigations. On the other hand, a new policy without bias promotes transparency and credibility among investors, both retail and institutional. While there may be short-term uncertainty around this change, long-term sustainability and trust are essential for maintaining a strong reputation and fostering a positive investor base. The board should prioritize these values and provide necessary education and guidance to mitigate potential disadvantages for small investors.", "e6": "As a board member, I would ask the management team for more specific details regarding the potential risks and liabilities that could arise from continued earnings under-reporting. Additionally, I would request a comparison of the financial impact on retail investors vs sophisticated hedge funds if the company were to switch to an unbiased reporting policy, factoring in the possibility of education and guidance to manage expectations among small investors. Furthermore, I'd be interested in understanding the long-term consequences of staying with the current bias policy in terms of reputation, potential legal implications, and possible competitive disadvantages when compared to other firms adopting transparent reporting practices.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "The first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system was Oumuamua.", "q10": "D"}
