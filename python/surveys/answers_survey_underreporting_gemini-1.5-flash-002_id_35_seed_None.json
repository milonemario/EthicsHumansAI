The new policy, while risking short-term market volatility, promotes transparency and long-term trust with investors.  The potential for misinterpretation is less damaging than the inherent dishonesty of the existing practice.  The long-term benefits of ethical behavior outweigh the short-term market risks.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents information fairly, avoids deliberate manipulation or obfuscation, and ensures all material information is disclosed.  Consistency in application over time is crucial.  While anticipating investor reactions is acceptable,  intentionally misleading them is unethical.  The policy should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups, aiming for fairness and avoiding exploitation of less sophisticated investors.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies used to bias earnings under the current policy, the process for implementing the new policy, and how the company plans to communicate the change to investors to mitigate the potential for short-term negative market reactions.
