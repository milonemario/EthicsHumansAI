While the intention behind the change is to be truthful, the potential consequences outweigh the benefits of adopting a more transparent approach.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, consistent, and honest. It should provide stakeholders with an accurate representation of the company's financial performance, without intentionally misleading them. In this context, the current policy's consistent over-reporting by a fixed amount ('smoothing') is problematic because it allows investors to anticipate and adjust for the bias, maintaining their trust in the reported earnings. This transparency reduces concerns about misrepresentation. On the other hand, adopting an unbiased reporting policy poses risks of investor expectations being violated, causing potential market consequences.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to clarify how they plan to communicate the change in policy to prevent investors from incorrectly assuming that reported earnings are biased. Additionally, I would like to know what specific measures they propose to take to mitigate potential market consequences and ensure a smooth transition for both investors and the company.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
