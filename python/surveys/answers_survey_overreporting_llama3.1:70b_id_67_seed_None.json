Some investors may not be aware of the change and misinterpret the reported earnings, leading to potential losses. The current policy's bias is already factored into investor decisions, minimizing harm. Maintaining the status quo avoids introducing uncertainty and potential harm to certain investors, particularly small retail investors who may not have access to the same information as larger institutions.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial situation, without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. Considerations such as consistency, comparability, and materiality are also crucial. Additionally, the policy should be accessible and understandable to all stakeholders, regardless of their level of sophistication. In the context of ABC Company, it is essential to consider the potential impact on different investor groups, including small retail investors who may not have the same resources or expertise as larger institutions.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more information on their plan for communicating the policy change to investors, particularly small retail investors, and how they intend to mitigate potential losses or confusion. Additionally, I would like to know what measures they will take to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the change and understand its implications. I would also ask about their plan for monitoring and addressing any unintended consequences that may arise from the policy change.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
