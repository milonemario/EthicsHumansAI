Some retail investors might be negatively impacted by this change, whereas sophisticated hedge funds would adjust accordingly. A more gradual phase-in or communication with investors about the policy change could help mitigate potential issues and ensure a smoother transition.", "e5": "A reporting policy can be considered ethical when it is transparent, honest, and free from manipulation. It should provide clear guidance to stakeholders, avoid misleading information, and facilitate informed decision-making. In the context of financial reporting, this includes disclosing any biases or adjustments that affect earnings calculations. Ethical policies also consider the impact on vulnerable groups, such as retail investors. They prioritize fairness, disclosure, and accountability over short-term gains or compliance with minimal requirements. Ultimately, an ethical policy balances transparency with prudence.", "e6": "", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 1}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
