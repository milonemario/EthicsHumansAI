Despite concerns of lower initial market performance or disadvantaging retail investors compared to sophisticated hedge funds, intra-company measures could help rectify inequality. Actions, like mandatory trainings or clear disclosures of new policy and earnings adjustments needed, can promote financial literacy amongst retail investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize openness, transparency, and consistency while avoiding any deceit or misrepresentation. In ABC's current policy under-reporting earnings per share creates a legal liability for the firm, contradicts best ethical standards, and may mislead various investors. To rectify these issues, it is essential to move towards unbiased reporting. Addressing concerns regarding investor understanding and potential disadvantaging of some investors can be resolved through clear communication initiatives and mitigation measures based on investor classification. Promoting greater financial literacy would minimize reliance on earnings adjustments from retail investors. Ultimately, upholding a high ethical standard across the entire investor community ensures the best long-term position for ABC's share price.", "e6": "As a board member, I would have the following follow-up questions for the management team regarding the underreporting of the EPS by 50 cents: - Does the company consistently underestimate expenses or overestimate revenues while reporting the financial results? If this under or over reportage exceeds 50 cents on occasion, this would indicate a troubling inconsistency on the firm's accounting practice. - How has this earnings underreporting over time impacted our relationship with investors, especially retail investors, and can we justify prolonged adoption of such policy? The board needs proof that the investor segment understands the need for adjustments and the company's willingness to communicate clearly in this regard. - Could the company implement steps towards financial literacy programs/initiatives within our communication measures with retail investors regarding these earnings adjustments and future potential changes?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "E", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "As a board member at ABC, it seems crucial to address the investor trust and compliance concerns. The first action should prioritize long-term viability over short-term gains and minimize potential legal issues. Although changing policies may initially face market resistance due to investor's adjustments in earnings per share (EPS), it is important to establish credibility and transparency, even if temporary negative effects on the stock price occur. In this case, the new policy should emphasize fairness and accurate financial reporting, with legal counsel's support and continuous communication strategies.", "q10": "D"}
