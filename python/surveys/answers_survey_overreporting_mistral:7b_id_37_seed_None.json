Although it may cause some initial discomfort for the investor relations team, consistent and accurate financial reporting is essential for long-term success and maintaining the trust of shareholders.", "e5": "In a reporting policy, ethics revolves around transparency, truthfulness, and consistency. The current ABC policy lacks these principles since it consciously over-reports earnings by 50 cents despite having investors recognize the need for adjustments. Such policy may subject the company to legal liability and unequal treatment of investors, particularly retail ones. An ethical reporting policy should be without bias, provide accurate and reliable financial information, and avoid practices that could harm shareholders or give certain groups an unfair advantage over others.", "e6": "To ensure an ethical reporting policy, it is crucial to address concerns related to legal liability, fairness, and transparency. I would ask for the management team's opinion on the following topics: What specific steps are being taken to minimize potential legal risks in light of possible SEC investigations? How does the board plan to educate retail investors about changes in the reporting policy and ensure a level playing field among all shareholders? Are there any measures being considered to mitigate the impact of sophisticated hedge funds trading against small investors due to their increased attention to these adjustments?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oleynick comet also known as 'Borisov'", "q10": "D"}
