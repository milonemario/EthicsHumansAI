Although there may be some short-term market volatility and potential disadvantages to retail investors, accurate reporting reduces the risk of regulatory issues and maintains trust with investors. It also aligns with best practices for financial transparency. The company's CFO may need to develop strategies to communicate the change effectively to investors and mitigate any potential negative impacts.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that financial information should be presented in a clear and concise manner, without any intentional distortion or omission of facts. The policy should also be consistent and reliable, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize fairness and accessibility, taking into account the needs and limitations of various stakeholder groups, such as retail investors. Considerations like regulatory compliance, accountability, and long-term sustainability are also important in evaluating the ethics of a reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide a plan for communicating the change in reporting policy to investors, including a strategy for educating retail investors about the new unbiased reporting approach. Additionally, I would request information on how they intend to mitigate any potential negative impacts on the company's stock price and investor relations. I would also like to know what measures will be taken to ensure that the change in reporting policy is implemented consistently across all financial reports and disclosures.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 3, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua)", "q10": "B"}
