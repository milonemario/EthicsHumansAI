Maintaining the current policy, despite its less-than-ideal ethical standing, appears to better manage the short-term risks and protect the company's long-term interests, especially given the impending equity fundraising.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, presenting financial information honestly and consistently.  It considers the impact on all stakeholders, including investors of different types and sophistication, and avoids manipulation or deception.
