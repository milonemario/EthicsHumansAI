Changing to a new policy in which earnings are without bias would align with these values and set an example for other companies, thereby fostering investor confidence in the long run. Education and transparency about the change should be implemented, so investors understand the true picture of ABC's performance.", "e5": "An ethical financial reporting policy should maintain transparency, honesty, and fairness towards all investors. In the scenario discussed, a reporting bias that investor communities understand and adjust for is questionable in terms of ethics due to potential legal liability and misuse as a competitive strategy against less sophisticated investors. A truly ethical policy would prioritize consistency, long-term sustainability, and integrity by presenting accurate, fair, and clear financial reports with no biases or hidden motives.", "e6": "It would be beneficial to ask questions for further clarification in order to make an informed decision. To better understand the impact on shareholders, I suggest asking about the specific risks to small-scale investors if a transparent reporting policy is not adopted and exploring potential strategies to minimize these risks. Additionally, it would be important to understand the timeline for raising new equity and addressing concerns regarding the market's reaction to adopting a no-bias reporting policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 3, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
