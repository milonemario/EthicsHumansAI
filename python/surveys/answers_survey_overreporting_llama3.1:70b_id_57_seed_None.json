Although some investors may initially misinterpret the change, it is essential for the company to provide unbiased information. Eventually, investors will adjust their expectations, and the company's credibility will increase. Additionally, maintaining an intentionally biased policy exposes the company to potential risks, including regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage. Adopting a new policy with unbiased earnings reporting supports long-term sustainability and integrity.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and consistent. Transparency allows stakeholders to make informed decisions, while accuracy ensures that information is reliable. Unbiased reporting eliminates the risk of misleading stakeholders, even if unintentionally. Consistency in reporting policies facilitates comparability and credibility. Considerations such as regulatory compliance, materiality of information, and context-specific nuances should also be taken into account. Furthermore, a policy should prioritize fairness and equal access to information for all stakeholders, avoiding situations where certain groups may be unfairly disadvantaged or privileged.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions.
