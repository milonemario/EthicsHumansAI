Switching to the new policy ensures transparency and honesty in financial reporting. Although some investors might initially be misled, this change promotes long-term trust and stability. Moreover, as transparent reporting becomes standard practice, investors will adapt and correctly interpret earnings reports without adjustments.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and clarity. It should provide accurate and unbiased information to all stakeholders, avoiding any intentional misrepresentation or withholding of material facts. Consistency in application and clear communication of changes are also essential. Furthermore, considering the context of publicly traded companies like ABC, I would emphasize that an ethical policy should be mindful of the diverse investor base, including both sophisticated and retail investors, ensuring fairness and equal access to information.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to further understand the potential impact of changing the reporting policy. Specifically, I would want to know more about the CFO's concerns regarding investor adjustment periods and how management plans to communicate the change in policy to investors. Additionally, what measures will be taken to educate retail investors and ensure they are not disproportionately disadvantaged? Finally, are there any plans for a transition period or additional disclosures to help stakeholders adjust to the new reporting policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
