This makes a more cautious approach, such as continuing with the current policy, more appealing than a potential change to the new policy.", "e5": "In an ethical reporting policy, I would expect accuracy and honesty to be paramount. This would mean disclosing all pertinent information without manipulation or misrepresentation. In the context of corporate reporting, this could involve being transparent about any adjustments or modifications made to data, such as the earnings per share (EPS) scenario with ABC company. Considerations specific to investor relations highlight the need for policymakers to balance clarity and accuracy with investor awareness, demonstrating an ongoing effort to educate stakeholders about policy nuances. This ensures market perceptions are aligned with reporting reality.", "e6": "Yes. I would want to clarify how they plan to address the potential confusion and misunderstanding among investors about the revised policy, especially those who might not be familiar with such changes or would struggle keeping up with the 'new normal'. Clarifying how investors will be educated and made aware of this change through existing communication channels (e.g., investor presentations, analyst meetings) as early as possible in implementing this transition would also be another pressing concern to explore. Ensuring that any potential benefits to transparency are balanced against this risk of confusing stakeholders seems crucial before making any final recommendations on updating reporting practices.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
