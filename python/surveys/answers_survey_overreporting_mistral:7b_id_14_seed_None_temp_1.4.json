Additionally, if we don't change the practice eventually, the consequences might become graver due to additional complexity when introducing further changes or facing more stringent regulations.", "e5": "In this scenario, an ethical reporting policy would be transparent, consistent, unbiased, and focused on preserving investor trust by providing accurate financial data. While acknowledging the potential risk of negative short-term consequences related to the new policy change, it's crucial to prioritize honesty and uphold the principles of ethical accountability. In this context, it's equally important for the company to make concerted efforts in communicating effectively with investors, addressing their concerns, and providing guidance on understanding and adapting to the updated report policy.", "e6": "In this complex situation, I would have follow-up questions for the management team to help gather relevant information and better understand their views. Besides questioning them about a timeline of reporting concerns within the firm, I would ask: 1) Why haven't internal policies been changed during your term or tenure? and 2) How do you plan to maintain investor trust while adopting a new unbiased policy, along with strategies for communicating the updated earnings report more effectively?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "A", "q4": "A", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
