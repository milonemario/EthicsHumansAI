Switching to the new policy, while risking a short-term negative market reaction, establishes long-term credibility and transparency.  The potential for investor misunderstanding is less damaging than the inherent dishonesty of the current system.  Open communication about the policy change can mitigate the negative market impact.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, unbiased, and consistent.  It prioritizes fair representation of the company's financial performance without manipulation.  While considering investor expectations, it avoids misleading practices or intentionally creating ambiguity.  It should also strive for clarity and easy understanding, promoting investor confidence and reducing information asymmetry.", "e6": "I would ask about their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, addressing concerns about potential misinterpretations.  I'd also inquire about the potential impact on different investor groups (retail vs. institutional) and what measures are in place to mitigate any negative consequences.
