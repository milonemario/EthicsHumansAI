However, under the current policy, investors are already adjusting for the bias, so the board would be switching from a 'known known' (biased but disclosed) to an unknown variable (unbiased but potentially misunderstood), which could lead to market volatility and undermine investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and honesty, avoiding practices that could be misleading or deceive stakeholders. It should also account for market realities, such as investors' expectations and behaviors. In this case, the current policy's consistency and acceptance by investors mitigate its negative implications. A more ethically defensible approach would be to phase out the bias over time, allowing investors to adjust gradually, rather than imposing an abrupt change that might cause undue volatility in the market.", "e6": "Yes. If we decide not to change the reporting policy, how will management ensure that investors understand and adjust for the bias?
