While more ethical, the potential for a negative market reaction, hurting investor confidence and potentially stock price, outweighs the benefits of greater transparency.  A more nuanced approach, perhaps mitigating the market impact through communication and investor relations strategies, may be necessary before changing the policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or misleading information, even if not explicitly lying.  Consideration of the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors of different sophistication levels, is crucial.  A well-communicated policy, explaining any potential adjustments and their rationale, can further enhance its ethical standing, and careful assessment of market reactions should be a key part of decision-making.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed analysis of potential market reactions to the new policy, including a worst-case scenario projection.  I'd also want to understand the specific investor relations plan for communicating the change to both sophisticated and retail investors.
