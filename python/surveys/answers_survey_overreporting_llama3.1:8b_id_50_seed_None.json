The CFO's concerns about investor communication and market reaction are valid reasons for sticking with the current policy.", "e5": "In my view, an ethical reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and consistent. It should not withhold or distort information to influence market behavior. No-bias reports would be ideal but might require clear communication about policy changes and potential implications. An additional consideration is fairness across investor types: policies that benefit some investors over others could create uneven playing fields. The policy should also consider the risk of increased market volatility or misinformation.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to know how the management team plans to address the potential market reaction and volatility if they were to switch to a no-bias policy.
