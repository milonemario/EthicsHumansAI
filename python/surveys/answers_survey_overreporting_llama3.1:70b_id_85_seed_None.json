Although there may be a short-term negative market reaction due to investors' initial misunderstanding of the change, I believe that long-term benefits outweigh these temporary costs. In the end, truthful and unbiased financial reporting will build trust with stakeholders, including investors, customers, and employees.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and consistent. This means that financial reports should reflect the true state of the company's performance without any intentional manipulation or omission of material information. The policy should also be communicated clearly to stakeholders, including investors, customers, and employees, so they can make informed decisions. Additionally, the policy should prioritize fairness and avoid creating an uneven playing field for different groups of stakeholders. Transparency is key, as it builds trust and credibility with stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. What specific steps will be taken to communicate the change in reporting policy to stakeholders, particularly investors and analysts? How will the investor relations team handle potential negative reactions from retail investors who may not understand the change in policy? Are there any contingency plans in place in case of a more significant market reaction than anticipated? Finally, how will the effectiveness of the new reporting policy be measured and evaluated over time?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
