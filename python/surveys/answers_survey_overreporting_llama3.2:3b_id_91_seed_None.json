Sophisticicated hedge funds may adjust accordingly, but small investors might not follow suit, making them vulnerable to decreased stock prices. As the CFO noted, making this change could 'punish us' in the market without changing investor behavior. A more gradual implementation or adjustments to mitigate its effects would be considered before making a final recommendation.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, honest, and free from material misrepresentation. It should allow for no misleading adjustments or biases that distort a company's true financial performance. In this context, not adjusting earnings per share (EPS) downward by 50 cents despite widespread knowledge among sophisticated investors suggests transparency. However, this transparency should be balanced with the need to ensure fairness and equity across all stakeholders, including retail investors who may rely on adjusted EPS. The policy should also facilitate clear and timely communication about any changes in earnings reporting practices.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about potential provisions or safeguards to mitigate any negative impacts on retail investors and to ensure their understanding of the new policy. Specifically, I would inquire about plans for investor education, warnings or caveats when announcing changes in reporting practices, and measures to safeguard against price volatility when introducing more accurate financial representations.", "e7": "Follow", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "PanSTARRS-PS1", "q10": "B"}
