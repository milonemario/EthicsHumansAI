Concealing the true financial picture, even if anticipated by savvy investors,  is fundamentally dishonest and exposes the company to legal risk. Transparency, though potentially disruptive initially, builds a stronger foundation for sustainable growth.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy. It presents financial information truthfully, without intentional manipulation or bias, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on a clear understanding of the company's performance. While considering market impact is important, it should never supersede the fundamental obligation to be honest and forthright in financial reporting. Building trust with stakeholders through ethical practices ultimately fosters long-term stability and success.", "e6": "Yes, I would have the following questions for management: 1. What strategies can we implement to effectively communicate the policy change to investors and minimize potential market disruption? 2.
