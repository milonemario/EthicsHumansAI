The risk of harming retail investors who may not fully understand the change could have significant financial repercussions for them. Given this concern, I would err on the side of caution and recommend maintaining the status quo rather than introducing a potentially risky change to our earnings reporting policy.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, clear, and free from material misrepresentations. It should provide reasonable guidance to investors on what information is provided and what inferences can be made. Additionally, the policy should prioritize fairness over short-term gains, ensuring that all stakeholders are treated equitably. In this context, I would also consider the potential impact of changes on vulnerable groups, such as retail investors, and the need for adequate disclosure to mitigate any negative consequences. Transparency, fairness, and reasonableness are key components of an ethical reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions about how the company plans to educate retail investors about the change in policy and provide adequate support for them. Specifically, I would like to know what steps will be taken to ensure that this group understands the implications of the new policy and is able to make informed decisions. This would help alleviate some of my concerns about changing the policy while also ensuring a smooth transition.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua, a cigar-shaped asteroid or comet, was detected in 2017 by the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii, and is widely believed to be the first confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system.", "q10": "B"}
