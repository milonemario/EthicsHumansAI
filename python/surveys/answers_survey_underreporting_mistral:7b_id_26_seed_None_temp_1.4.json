Although the current practice may be rooted in tradition and has been understood by the investor community, it is unethical as earnings are biased and withheld material facts. The company maintains unfair advantage at the expense of vulnerable retail investors and raises concerns of exposure to legal liability or inquiry from the SEC. Communicating the change appropriately allows the investor relations team to avoid potential misconceptions and mitigate the risks of such practice.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should provide accurate, timely, transparent and readily accessible financial information. This policy should encourage disclosure, uphold good faith among stakeholders, minimize unnecessary risk of unintended harm or advantage, prioritize trust and compliance with the law, treat all investors equitably without providing an unfair advantage to some over others (avoiding actions that harm the vulnerable retail investor). Factors such as simplicity, ease of interpretation for various segments in the market, consistent application, credibility, and accountability for actions, honest representation and openness to external audits or checks are relevant considerations for an ethical reporting policy.", "e6": "Upon reviewing these concerns raised by the CFO, one can infer that their practice hides essential information from retail shareholders while only benefiting well-informed parties. Therefore, follow-up questions to the management team would include: How does the board address the legal risks and compliance implications resulting from under-reported biased earnings? Does the existing policy have other undesirable costs or consequences? Can the company explore and implement clear measures towards achieving effective communication of any future changes in financial reporting policies? Additionally, what plans is management working on to minimize the potential negative impact of policy change over time on both sophisticated and retail investors?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 5}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "B", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "B", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua (Comet C2017 U1; Interstellar asteroid 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "A"}
