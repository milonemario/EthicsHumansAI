Retail investors who are not monitoring the company closely might be blindsided by the decrease in reported earnings and could incur significant losses. This risk outweighs any potential benefits of the new policy, which is intended to shield the company from short-term market volatility.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, honest, and fair. It should provide stakeholders with accurate information about the company's financial performance, without withholding or misrepresenting data to achieve a specific agenda. The policy should also consider the interests of all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be vulnerable to market fluctuations. Additionally, I would look for policies that disclose any biases or assumptions underlying the reporting, and provide context for investors to understand the implications of the reported figures. This promotes trust and accountability in financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team, such as: How will you ensure that retail investors are adequately informed and protected from market fluctuations? What measures will be put in place to monitor and address any potential negative impacts on the company's stock price?
