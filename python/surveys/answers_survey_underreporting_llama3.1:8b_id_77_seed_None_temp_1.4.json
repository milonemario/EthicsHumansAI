The CEO's hesitation implies that if the truth is released abruptly, these savvy analysts would trade at an advantage over unsophisticated or retail investors who failed to adjust their expectations accordingly, likely causing market instability or favoritism. Maintaining the same misleading information may be more honest than opening up investors to differentiating 'insider knowledge', and allow all class of investors a consistent understanding.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and consistent.

Some additional considerations for investigation might be whether or not certain fund types of investor, perhaps because better education, experience with financial markets, training, that etc have ability to understand when this bias actually starts and will stop?
