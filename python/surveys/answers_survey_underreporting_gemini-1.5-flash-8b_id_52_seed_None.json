The current policy, while perhaps less disruptive in the short term, is fundamentally dishonest and builds a culture of manipulating financial reporting. This long-term damage to the company's credibility is a greater risk than the potential for a short-term adjustment in investor perception of the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any intentional manipulation or misrepresentation, even if investors may interpret the numbers differently.  Full disclosure of accounting methods and any potential biases is crucial.  The policy must maintain a consistent approach over time to foster trust and avoid the appearance of gaming the system.  Ultimately, the policy should reflect a commitment to providing investors with a clear and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd want to understand the specific mechanics of the current policy, the predicted impact of the new policy on various investor segments (including retail, sophisticated funds, and institutional investors), and the potential short-term and long-term financial and reputational risks associated with the policy change.  Furthermore, I'd want to know how the policy change fits into the company's broader strategic goals and long-term investor relations strategy.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
