The potential benefits of greater transparency and accuracy in reporting earnings outweigh the risks of confusing some investor groups who rely on the current bias. However, I would propose a transition period to mitigate this risk and ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the change. This might involve educating investor relations teams and retail investors about the new policy, as well as monitoring their reactions to the change.", "e5": "I believe an ethical reporting policy should prioritize clarity, accuracy, and consistency. It should be free from bias and manipulation that could deceive or mislead investors. The policy should also consider the needs of various investor groups, including retail investors who may not have the resources to adjust for biases. Additionally, the policy should be transparent about any adjustments or corrections made to reported earnings, and should be communicated in a clear and timely manner. This transparency and consistency would foster trust and confidence among stakeholders, which are essential components of an ethical reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions to ensure a thorough understanding of the potential impact on retail investors and the market.
