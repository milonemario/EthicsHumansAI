The potential for the market to punish the company for an apparent poor performance due to the change (even with a justifiable reason) is a risk worth taking.  Transparency and honesty are paramount, even when challenging.  Adopting the new policy aligns with these principles.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids intentional manipulation, even if seemingly beneficial in the short-term.  Consideration should be given to investor sophistication, the potential impact on different investor groups (e.g., retail vs. institutional), and the long-term reputation of the company.  A good policy fosters trust and maintains integrity, even when navigating complex market dynamics.", "e6": "Yes.  I would want to understand the specific market research supporting the anticipated investor reaction to the new policy, including potential damage to investor sentiment, and the methodology by which the 50-cent adjustment is determined.  Also, what specific strategies are in place to communicate the change transparently and address investor concerns? Finally, what steps are being taken to mitigate potential short-term disadvantages for retail investors, recognizing their reduced ability to understand or adjust to the policy change.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
