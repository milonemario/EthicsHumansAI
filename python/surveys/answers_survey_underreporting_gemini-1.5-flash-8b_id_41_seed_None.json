The CFO's concerns about investor reaction and maintaining credibility are valid, suggesting a risk that outweighs the likely benefits in the current market environment.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy, avoiding any intentional manipulation or deception.  Considerations include investor sophistication, market impact, potential harm to retail investors, and the overall long-term reputation of the company.  The policy should strive to present a true and fair picture of financial performance, even if that means temporarily facing potential market volatility, while ensuring that the disclosures are understandable and not misleading, particularly for less sophisticated investors.", "e6": "Yes.  I would want to understand the specific anticipated market reaction to the new policy, the details of the investor relations plan to communicate the change, and a specific plan to mitigate potential negative impacts on retail investors.  Quantifiable measures for both short-term and long-term risk mitigation should be presented.  Finally,  I'd want to understand the predicted impact of the proposed change on the company's ability to raise future capital.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
