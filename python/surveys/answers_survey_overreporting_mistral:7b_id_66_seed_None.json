While changing to an unbiased policy may initially cause short-term market volatility or perceived 'bad performance,' ultimately it is crucial to uphold truthful financial reporting to avoid legal liability, misleading investors, and fostering a culture of transparency and integrity.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should aim to accurately and transparently reflect a company's financial performance, thereby fostering trust with investors. In this context, bias in earnings reports can undermine investor confidence over time and may expose the firm to legal liability or regulatory investigations. The board's responsibility is to uphold high standards of transparency and integrity, which requires a consistent, unbiased reporting policy. Any policy changes should be communicated effectively and honestly, being mindful of potential market reactivity and addressing any unintended impacts on different classes of investors.", "e6": "As a board member, it is crucial to explore further the long-term implications of adopting a no-bias reporting policy. I would ask the management team to investigate ways in which investor relations could effectively communicate the change and mitigate potential market reactivity or misconceptions regarding 'bad performance.'

The answer would depend on a variety of factors such as the board's values, responsibility to shareholders, and legal implications. It is not possible to determine one correct or 'definitive' answer because the scenario provides multiple considerations. However, the given explanation highlights that adjusting earnings downward removes any bias, reduces the risk of legal liability or investigation, and is in line with ethical standards. Changing the practice would also level the playing field for small investors who are currently disadvantaged by the current policy. Ultimately, whether to adjust the policy depends on the board's judgment about these factors.", "q10": "D"}
