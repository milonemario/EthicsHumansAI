It aligns with ethical principles and reduces potential legal risks. Additionally, it treats all investors equally, rather than giving an advantage to sophisticated hedge funds who are aware of the current bias. Although some retail investors might initially overreact to the change, transparency and clarity about the new reporting policy can help mitigate this impact.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should provide a clear and unbiased picture of the company's financial situation, without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. This includes avoiding practices like consistently under- or over-reporting earnings to manage expectations. Additionally, an ethical policy would consider the potential impact on all investor groups, not just sophisticated ones, and strive for consistency and reliability in reporting. It should also be free from conflicts of interest and avoid creating unintended advantages for certain stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions. For instance, what is the management team's plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and stakeholders? How will they ensure that all investor groups are aware of the new unbiased reporting approach? Are there any plans to restate historical financial statements to reflect the new reporting methodology? Additionally, how will the company measure the effectiveness of this change and address any potential short-term market volatility?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
