Maintaining a policy of known bias, even if investors anticipate it, creates a system of hidden assumptions.  The new policy, though potentially misunderstood initially, fosters greater trust and accuracy over the long term, ultimately benefiting the company's reputation and investor relations.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids intentional manipulation or ambiguity, ensuring that financial statements reflect the true financial position and performance of the company.  This includes clear disclosure of accounting methods, consistent application over time, and a commitment to fair presentation, even if this might present short-term challenges.  Investors deserve a clear, unbiased picture of the company's situation.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about the projected impact of the policy change on investor sentiment, specifically the potential for short-term negative reactions and strategies for managing investor communication during this transition.  Also, I would inquire about the specific measures taken to ensure unbiased accounting practices under the new policy and whether the previous policy's bias was documented or formally approved.  Finally, I'd want to know the company's plans to address potential trading advantages by sophisticated investors against retail investors if the new policy is adopted.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
