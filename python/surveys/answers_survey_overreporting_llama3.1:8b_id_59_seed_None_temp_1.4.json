Given the lack of identified benefits or gains, other than possibly making financial officers' lives easier, it might not be worth adopting the new policy.", "e5": "To me, an ethical reporting policy should involve transparent and accurate disclosure of financial information without manipulation. It's essential to avoid hiding potential bias or making statements that might mislead investors. A good policy should also consider the interests of various stakeholders, not just prioritize profit maximization. In this context, considering the needs and protection of small investors alongside more sophisticated ones is vital for an ethical reporting approach.", "e6": "To further assess the ethical implications, I would ask the management team to provide evidence and supporting data for their claims that small investors would be significantly harmed by switching to an unbiased reporting policy. If there are existing mechanisms to protect these investors or address potential short-term losses, I'd like to know about them. Additionally, I might inquire about possible future updates to reporting standards and how they align with the organization's long-term vision for transparency in financial disclosure.", "e7": "Against", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 1, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 4, "g": 3, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
