The new policy, despite possible investor misinterpretations initially, fosters greater transparency and long-term investor trust.  The potential for reputational damage and investor mistrust resulting from continued earnings manipulation outweighs the short-term concerns. A company with integrity and transparent accounting practices is better positioned for long-term success.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deception, even if seemingly beneficial in the short term.  Full disclosure of material information, consistent application of accounting standards, and a commitment to fair presentation of financial results are crucial.  Investor trust, long-term sustainability, and a positive corporate reputation are paramount considerations beyond immediate market reactions.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask about the specific anticipated market reactions to the new policy, potential investor education strategies, and how the company will communicate the change effectively and transparently to avoid misunderstandings, particularly regarding the retail investor segment.  Also, a detailed analysis of the potential long-term impact on the company's stock valuation and the likelihood of long-term investor trust erosion stemming from the current practice would be necessary.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
