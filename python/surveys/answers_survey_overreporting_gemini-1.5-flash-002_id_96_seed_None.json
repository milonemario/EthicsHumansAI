Maintaining transparency and accurate reporting builds long-term investor confidence and trust, which is more valuable than artificially inflated short-term stock prices.  The potential for a temporary market downturn should not supersede the importance of ethical conduct.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and consistently applied.  It avoids intentional bias or manipulation to present a favorable but misleading picture.  It should also consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be less sophisticated, and strive for fair and equitable information disclosure.  Materiality of information should also be considered in deciding what to report.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market impact of switching to the unbiased policy.  I'd also want to understand their plan to communicate the policy change clearly and proactively to investors, mitigating potential misunderstandings.
