Maintaining the current policy, which involves intentional bias, is ethically problematic and unsustainable.  The new policy, while initially disruptive, establishes a foundation of trust and reduces future reputational risks.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes accuracy and transparency.  It presents financial information fairly, without intentional bias or manipulation, even if this means facing short-term market volatility.  It considers the needs of all stakeholders, not just investors, and avoids practices that could unfairly disadvantage certain investor groups.  It maintains consistency over time, preventing sudden changes that could be misinterpreted or used for manipulative purposes.  It also adheres to all applicable accounting standards and legal requirements.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to detail their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, including how they will address potential misinterpretations and mitigate the short-term market risks.  I'd also want to understand their assessment of the impact on different investor groups and any steps taken to ensure fair treatment. Finally, I'd inquire about the long-term strategic goals and how transparent reporting aligns with them.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
