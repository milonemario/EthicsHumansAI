Maintaining the current, albeit problematic, policy seems the more prudent choice in the short-term to avoid a potentially damaging market response.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deception, regardless of anticipated market reaction.  Considerations include the potential impact on all stakeholders (investors, employees, customers),  the overall integrity of the company, and adherence to relevant accounting standards and regulations.  The policy should be consistently applied and justified, not influenced by short-term gains or investor relations strategies.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions about the specific market research supporting the CFO's concerns about investor reaction.  Also, I would want to understand the potential long-term risks of maintaining the current policy (e.g., reputational damage, investor distrust), as well as the details of how the \"50-cent bias\" is calculated and justified.  Finally, I'd inquire about alternative communication strategies to mitigate potential investor anxieties while maintaining the integrity of the new policy.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
