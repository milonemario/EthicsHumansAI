The board members may want to find an option that balances honest reporting, consistent communications, and investor relations. For example, one possible approach could involve implementing transparency measures during the change in policy and carefully communicating to investors prior to the adjustment, allowing both retail and sophisticated investors alike fair chance at making informed investment decisions.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes truth, transparency, and fairness in financial reporting. Considerations that should be accounted for in this context include: avoiding deception or under-reporting of actual performance; ensuring consistent, unbiased information for all investors to minimize any advantages for a select few; and maintaining trust between the firm and its customers by providing accurate representations of earnings. The CFO's concerns about communicating a change in policy, as well as impact on retail versus sophisticated investors, highlights the importance of carefully managing such changes while emphasizing transparency and fairness.", "e6": "Considering the insights provided, further questions could clarify if there are alternative ways to satisfy investor relations while upgrading financial reporting's transparency with an acceptable minimum impact on small investors: Is there any evidence supporting the claim that adjusts for earnings downward when reported without bias would lead the markets to initially devalue AB's stock? Has a study regarding earnings perception among retail and sophisticated fund investors been performed, or do board members hold an overrated estimate of retail ignorance in this situation?
