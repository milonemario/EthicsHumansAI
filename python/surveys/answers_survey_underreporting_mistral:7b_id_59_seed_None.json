Given the potential legal and reputational risks associated with the current policy, I recommend changing to the new policy in which earnings are reported without bias. While concerns about investor understanding and market implications are valid, they can be addressed through clear communication and investor education programs. It is unacceptable to intentionally deceive investors or favor certain classes over others.", "e5": "Ethical reporting policies should strive for accuracy, transparency, fairness, and consistency. It's crucial that investors receive unbiased financial information about a company so they can make informed decisions and trust the firm. This requires honesty in disclosing EPS without manipulation or adjustment by management. Potential risks, such as adverse market reactions to changes or disadvantaging certain investor classes, should be carefully managed through clear communication plans and education initiatives targeted at all investors. Avoiding intentional deception helps maintain the long-term reputation and growth of a company.", "e6": "Based on the CFO's concerns, I have follow-up questions regarding the company's communication strategy with investors under the new policy and how they plan to address confusion or misconceptions among retail investors.
