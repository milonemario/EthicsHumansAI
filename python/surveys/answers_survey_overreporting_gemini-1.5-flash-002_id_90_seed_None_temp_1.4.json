While the current policy avoids immediate negative market reaction, it's deceptive.  The new policy, although risky initially, fosters trust and transparency, which are more valuable in the long run.  The short-term price dip will be less damaging than reputational harm from continued deception.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy. It presents financial information fairly, without intentional manipulation or bias, even if it means short-term market volatility.  It considers all stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the public.  Clarity in methodology and consistent application of accounting principles are paramount, allowing investors to make informed decisions without needing to decode hidden biases or manipulations.", "e6": "I'd ask about the detailed plan for communicating the policy change to investors, addressing their concerns proactively.  I'd also want a risk assessment outlining potential short-term market impacts and strategies for mitigating them.  Finally, I'd ask for a timeline for implementation and metrics to track the effectiveness of the communication strategy and the impact on investor perception.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
