The CFO anticipates that changing the policy will only lead short-term market appreciation, followed by investors later discovering and then penalizing the company for lower performance. As informed investors adjust their estimates to be consistent with this bias in advance, the current reporting practice may already account for any adverse 'surprises.' Switching to unbiased reported earnings is seen as inconsequential for both informed institutional investors (as they adapt quickly) and for savvy management in forecasting, while potentially leading a mismatch which will end up being more burdensome and hurt most retail investors with inaccurate beliefs and limited insight when reporting no longer biases the earnings upward or downward.", "e5": "In the context of financial reporting, an ethical policy should prioritize transparency and truthfulness. It should neither intentionally mislead nor deceive investors or stakeholders. The policy should clearly convey accurate information, disclose relevant biases, and avoid creating unnecessary complexity or confusion. Furthermore, it should strive to educate investors about any potential implications of a more unbiased approach, minimizing the risk of disparities between reported earnings and market expectations.", "e6": "Yes.
