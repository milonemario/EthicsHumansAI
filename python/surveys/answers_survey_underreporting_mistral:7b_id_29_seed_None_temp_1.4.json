Moreover, ethical implications such as being perceived as dishonest should drive a decision for the CFO and board towards implementation of the new policy, despite potential challenges such as investor unease about lower reported earnings.", "e5": "In ethical reporting policy considerations, accuracy and transparency are paramount to investor trust. The current policy, characterized by systematic bias in earnings, lacks transparent communication to investors about earnings growth as it requires continued adjustments within the investor community to fully reflect actual performance. Additionally, an emphasis on social equity entails that the firm be aware of unequal information access between sophisticated and less informed investors, taking proper account for protecting smaller retail investors by favoring a policy without such inherent bias in reporting", "e6": "The concerns presented by the CFO suggest three areas of inquiry for further investigation. First, to clarify legal liability exposure risks and ramifications of SEC investigations; secondly, to discuss specific means that might better facilitate communication to all investors regarding changes in reporting policy without inducing over-corrected adjustments from both smaller & savvy institutional investor bases; Lastly, explore the opportunity costs due to delaying adoption for retail investors.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 4, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "adopt a new transparent financial-reporting policy with no bias in earnings", "q10": "A"}
