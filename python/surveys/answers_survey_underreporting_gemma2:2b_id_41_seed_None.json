A sudden change could create market instability and negatively impact investor confidence, especially investors who have relied upon the current system for years. This is also due to a lack of knowledge about how long they can handle this new reporting policy. Waiting after understanding market behaviour of various players in order to avoid negative consequences will benefit ABC company. ", "e5": "A truly ethical reporting policy reflects a commitment to transparency and honesty. It starts with disclosing all material information honestly, regardless of profit-seeking biases.  It avoids misleading investors through manipulation of reported figures with consistent communication. Furthermore, policies need to clearly outline the reason for their use to ensure proper alignment with market conditions.", "e6": "Yes, there are several follow-up questions that I have regarding this situation.  I would want to understand : 1) Specific reasons for pushing for this change, alongside expectations from investors. 2) What happens when investors push back or don't appreciate the changes? 3) Our communication strategy in detail, including how we will communicate with our investor base and other stakeholders regarding the transition period. 4) In regards to long-term performance, what makes us confident that this new policy benefits the company for years to come and is more sustainable than the preceding policy?", "e7": "Against", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "B", "q9": "The Oort Cloud", "q10": "D"}
