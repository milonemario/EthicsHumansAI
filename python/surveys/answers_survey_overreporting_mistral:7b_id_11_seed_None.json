The CFO's concerns regarding the impact on investor relations and retail investors can be mitigated by clearly communicating the change in policy, emphasizing the shift towards honest reporting as a positive long-term strategy, and providing investor guidance on adjusting their earnings expectations.", "e5": "The characteristics of an ethical reporting policy should include transparency, honesty and adherence to legal regulations. In this situation, the consistency of over-reporting earnings by prior management exposed ABC company to potential legal liability or investigation by the SEC.

The board must consider the concerns of all stakeholders, including sophisticated hedge funds and retail investors alike, ensuring that any change in policy doesn't disadvantage one group over another while promoting long-term investor trust and financial stability.", "e6": "Given CFO's concerns over investor relations, I would ask for a detailed plan on how the company will communicate the change in policy in a way that minimizes misunderstandings and maintains investors trust.
