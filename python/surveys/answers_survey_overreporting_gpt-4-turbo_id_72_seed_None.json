Communication about any policy changes should be clear and comprehensive to avoid misinterpretation or disadvantage to less sophisticated investors.", "e6": "How will the transition to the new policy be communicated to ensure all investors, especially retail investors, are adequately informed and do not misinterpret the initial unbiased reports as a decline in performance?
