Even if sophisticated hedge funds understand the true bias in earnings, smaller investors may still be negatively affected by the change. I believe that it is reasonable for these investors to have confidence in the reported EPS without needing to adjust for a pre-existing bias. Therefore, I would not recommend changing to the new policy unless there are compelling reasons to do so.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that provides transparent and accurate information to all stakeholders, without hiding or manipulating data. It should eliminate bias and any pre-existing knowledge that may influence investor perceptions. An ethical policy also considers the potential impact on various groups, including retail investors, sophisticated hedge funds, and employees. It should weigh the benefits of transparency against the potential risks and consequences. Lastly, it should prioritize consistency, fairness, and accuracy in financial reporting, ensuring that all relevant information is disclosed promptly and with proper context.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to further understand the management team's reasoning for proposing the change and address my concerns.
