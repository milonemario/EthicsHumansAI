This would reduce the risk of legal liability and potential investigations by regulatory bodies. Additionally, unbiased reporting would provide a more accurate representation of the company's financial performance, allowing investors to make informed decisions. While there may be short-term challenges in communicating this change to investors, the long-term benefits of improved transparency and credibility outweigh these concerns.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and unbiased. This means providing accurate and reliable information that presents a fair representation of the company's financial performance, without intent to mislead or deceive investors. Considerations such as consistency, comparability, and materiality should also be taken into account. Furthermore, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize clarity and ease of understanding, avoiding complexity that may confuse stakeholders.
