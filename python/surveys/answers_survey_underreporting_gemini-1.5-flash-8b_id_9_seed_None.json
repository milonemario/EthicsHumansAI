The CFO's concerns about investor relations and retail investor impact are significant enough to outweigh the potential benefits of transparency in this case.  A sudden shift to an unbiased policy could severely damage investor trust and short-term performance.  A more gradual approach and communication strategy should be explored if a change is ultimately decided upon.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, presenting financial information truthfully and without material misrepresentation, regardless of potential short-term market impact.  It considers the diverse interests of all stakeholders, not just shareholders, and avoids actions that could unfairly advantage some over others.  Accountability and a commitment to consistent, understandable reporting are crucial, along with robust internal controls to ensure the accuracy of the figures.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed analysis of the potential investor reaction to the change in policy, including a breakdown of expected short-term and long-term impacts on different investor segments.  Furthermore, what specific communication strategies would be implemented to explain the policy change to investors, and how would investor relations address concerns and maintain credibility during the transition?
