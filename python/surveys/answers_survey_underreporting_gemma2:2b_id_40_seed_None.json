This predictability allows investors to make informed decisions despite being aware of a consistent underreporting.  However, the potential harm from not aligning ethical standards with those expectations could be significant in the long term.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparent, accurate financial information that represents a company's true performance. It avoids manipulative practices that might mislead investors or manipulate expectations to generate favorable outcomes for the company in the short-term at the expense of long-term trust and investor confidence. Consistency in this approach strengthens credibility within the financial markets  and fosters ethical business conduct which ultimately benefits all stakeholders.", "e6": "I'll need to investigate further, but I also want an in-depth analysis of how this new policy might affect: 1. investor psychology: How has their long-standing expectations for lower reported EPS affected long-term investments, and will these behaviors change with the new regime? 2. SEC compliance and related legal liabilities. Is there a precedent that could guide us in any aspect of this practice?
