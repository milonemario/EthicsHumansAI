It should clearly disclose all relevant information to investors, without manipulation or intentional omission. In the context of financial reporting, this means presenting a true picture of a company's performance, without attempting to influence or manipulate investor beliefs or expectations. Any accounting biases or estimates should be clearly disclosed and explained, so that investors can make informed decisions.", "e6": "Yes.
