It should not intentionally mislead or deceive stakeholders through biased reporting. Consistency in reporting is important, but if changes are made, they should be clearly communicated to investors. The policy should also consider the potential impact on all investor groups, not just sophisticated ones, and ensure that no subgroup is systematically disadvantaged. Additionally, the policy should align with regulatory requirements and industry standards, minimizing the risk of investigations or legal liability.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to clarify why they have not changed the policy despite acknowledging its inaccuracy, and what specific steps they plan to take to educate investors about any changes to the reporting policy. Additional questions might include: What is the estimated market impact of changing the policy? How will you ensure that all investor groups are kept informed of the change? Are there any potential regulatory implications of maintaining the current policy?", "e7": "Follow", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
