The current practice of over-reporting earnings is unethical and exposes the firm to legal liability or an investigation by the SEC. While the CFO's concerns about communicating the change in policy to investors and potential disadvantaging of small investors are valid, I believe they can be effectively addressed through transparent disclosure and investor education. The long-term interest of stakeholders demands that we prioritize honest reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should reflect honesty, transparency, and consistency. To ensure investor trust, reported earnings must truthfully represent the actual performance of the company. In this context, a bias in reported EPS could expose the firm to legal consequences or investigations by the SEC. It is important for all stakeholders, retail investors included, to have access to accurate financial information necessary for informed decision-making. Additionally, any changes in reporting policy should be accompanied by adequate disclosure and investor education to address concerns of market overreaction and potential exploitation of small investors.", "e6": "I would ask the management team about strategies for transparent disclosure of the change in reporting policy and educational materials to inform investors about the reasons behind adopting a new bias-free policy, especially targeting retail investors.

Changing the policy without bias may be beneficial for internal operations, but carries potential risks such as loss of confidence in the company's financials and an unfair advantage for sophisticated investors over small retail ones.", "q10": "A"}
