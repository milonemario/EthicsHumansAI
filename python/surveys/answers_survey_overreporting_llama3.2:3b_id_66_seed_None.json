While the New Policy would avoid potential legal liability, it also poses a risk of harming retail investors who may be sensitive to changes in reporting styles. The company can educate retail investors about the historical bias, while continuing to provide unbiased information to sophisticated investors. This approach acknowledges the trade-offs between competing interests and prioritizes fairness and clarity in financial reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should provide clear guidance on what information is included in financial reports, how it is calculated, and any significant assumptions or biases that may affect the numbers. The policy should also consider the potential impact on various stakeholders, including retail investors, sophisticated investors, and the company's reputation. Additionally, an ethical policy would ensure that the company acts with integrity, promptly discloses material information, and cooperates with investigations and regulatory bodies. This ensures trustworthiness and accountability in financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask additional questions to better understand the company's consideration of the new policy. Specifically, I would ask about the plan for communicating changes to the reporting style to retail investors, how retention rates will be affected by this change, and what specific metrics or KPIs the company plans to use to measure success with the new policy.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 2, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (PANSTARRS)", "q10": "B"}
