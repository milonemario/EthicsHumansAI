The new policy lacks transparency and may lead to unintended consequences, such as some investors benefiting at the expense of others. In contrast, the current policy allows investors to anticipate the bias and make informed decisions. While I understand the frustration with the existing policy, I believe its transparency outweighs the potential benefits of the new policy.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and fair to all stakeholders. It should accurately reflect the company's financial situation without misrepresenting or concealing information. In this context, a policy that allows investors to anticipate biases can be seen as ethical because it maintains honesty and integrity in financial reporting. However, policies that may deceive or mislead certain groups of investors, even if beneficial to the company as a whole, raise concerns about fairness and equity. Transparency and accountability are crucial when making decisions that affect investor rights.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
