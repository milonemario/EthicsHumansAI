This potential short-term gain followed by long-term loss might make it more prudent to stick with the current policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is one that prioritizes transparency and honesty, avoiding manipulation or suppression of information. It should be clear, consistent, and free from bias or conflicts of interest. In this context, not misleading investors who have adapted to the current policy's biases, but also not intentionally deceiving them, is a key consideration. A more nuanced approach might weigh the short-term benefits against potential long-term damage to trust and investor relationships.", "e6": "Yes. Some potential follow-up questions could be: What changes would be implemented to communicate the new policy and its implications to investors?
