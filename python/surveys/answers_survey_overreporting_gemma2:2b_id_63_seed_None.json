A 'no' recommendation underscores understanding that changing the current biased reporting to an unbiased one could affect investor perception but may be seen as unethical or dishonest depending on how specific investors interpret it, leading to unforeseen consequences. Furthermore, a more detailed cost-benefit analysis would provide a better framework for decision making and mitigate risk.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, honesty, and legal compliance above all else.
