A careful, phased approach to communication and investor education might be needed before implementing the new policy to mitigate any adverse effects on the company's short-term stock price and investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or misrepresentation of financial data, even if it might be perceived as beneficial in the short term.  Crucially, the policy should be consistently applied and clearly communicated to all stakeholders, including investors, to foster trust and avoid misleading them.  Consideration must also be given to the potential impact on different investor groups (e.g., sophisticated vs. retail) and how the reporting policy is likely to be perceived by them.  Avoiding practices that give one group an unfair advantage over another is paramount.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed plan to communicate the change in policy to investors.  This should include a timeline, specific messaging, and anticipated responses from different investor segments (sophisticated vs. retail).
