Transparency and honesty are essential for sustainable growth, and although some investors might initially react negatively to the lack of a 'bias', the long-term benefits of trust and a reputation for integrity outweigh the potential short-term market fluctuations.  The current policy, though seemingly beneficial in the short term, is ultimately a risky, ethically questionable practice.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should present financial information truthfully and avoid any manipulation or deception, even if it might seem beneficial in the short term.  Consideration must be given to investor sophistication and the potential impact of the policy on different investor groups, but never at the cost of truthful reporting.  Consistency and clear communication of the policy, especially to avoid misleading expectations, are paramount.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd ask about the specific methodologies used to arrive at the current biased earnings figures, the potential quantitative impact on future earnings reports if the bias is removed, and the projected market reaction to the change in policy, along with a plan to mitigate potential negative investor sentiment.  Furthermore, I'd want to understand the specific types of investors who are most likely to be negatively affected by the change, and how the company plans to communicate the policy change to these investors, particularly concerning the potential for hedge funds trading against smaller investors.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
