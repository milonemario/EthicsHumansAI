The new policy may promote transparency and honesty, but it also risks causing short-term market instability and potentially harming retail investors who do not understand the change. A more informed decision would require careful analysis of these factors, consulting with experts, stakeholders, and considering alternative approaches to address concerns about bias in reported earnings.", "e5": "A reporting policy can be considered ethical if it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should avoid biased or misleading information that could deceive investors. In this context, I would value a policy that provides clear guidance on the methodology used to calculate earnings per share, discloses any material adjustments made to reported figures, and ensures that investors have access to relevant data and analysis to make informed decisions. Additionally, transparency about potential risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting is essential to maintain trust and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.", "e6": "Yes. Specifically, I would ask about the plan for educating retail investors about the change in policy and mitigating potential negative market reactions. Additionally, I would like to know more about the monitoring and review processes in place to ensure compliance with the new policy and address any potential issues that may arise.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Ommana", "q10": "B"}
