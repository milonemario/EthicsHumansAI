Retail investors may find themselves negatively impacted if the adjustment of reported earnings does not accurately depict company performance.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should exhibit neutrality, fairness, openness/transparency, and legal compliance. In essence, a firm's earnings reporting must represent an honest reflection of its profitability to investors, without bias or favoritism. Such practices enhance trust from stakeholders and promote sustainable growth with long-term value generation. To that end, ethical concerns arising in the case scenario relate to potential deceit or misleading information, legal liability risks, harm towards retail investors and a possible unlevel playing field between sophisticated investors and small retail shareholders, ultimately tarnishing Company ABC's positive reputation.", "e6": "It is essential for management to clarify how they communicate a potential policy change, in this case, from biased to unbiased earnings reporting. One approach could involve communicating transparently why the adjustment needs to be made as a commitment to enhanced transparency and fairness towards all investors, no matter their size or sophistication. Furthermore, management should dispel any misconceptions about market reaction, educate investors regarding the changes in policy accurately, thereby ensuring that small & sophisticated investors are not unfairly advantageered in trading.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 5}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "C", "q7": "A", "q8": "B", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
