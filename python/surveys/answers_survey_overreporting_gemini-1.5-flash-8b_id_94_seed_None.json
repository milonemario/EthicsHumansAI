Transparency, even if it initially leads to investor uncertainty, fosters long-term trust and a more sustainable business model.  The current policy's inherent bias, though understood by some, suggests a lack of integrity and could ultimately harm investor confidence over time.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or bias, presenting a clear and complete picture of the company's financial performance.
