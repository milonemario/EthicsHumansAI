It avoids deliberate manipulation or bias to present a more favorable picture.  It should be consistently applied, readily understandable to investors of varying sophistication, and  comply with all applicable regulations.  Materiality is key; minor discrepancies don't necessarily make a policy unethical, but intentional misrepresentation of significant data is.  The goal should be to provide a true and fair view of the company's financial position.", "e6": "I'd ask about the specific methods used to bias earnings under the old policy, the projected impact on investor relations and the timeline for implementing the new policy and investor communication strategy around this transition.
