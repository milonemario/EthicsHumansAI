Although some investors may be caught off guard by the change, it is better for the company to report its true earnings rather than maintaining a biased practice that could lead to legal issues or reputational damage. The benefits of honest reporting outweigh the potential short-term drawbacks, such as market volatility or uneven impacts on different investor groups.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should provide a clear and unbiased picture of the company's financial situation, without intentionally omitting or distorting information to mislead stakeholders. The policy should also be consistent and reliable, allowing investors and other users to make informed decisions based on trustworthy data. Additionally, it is essential to consider the diversity of stakeholders, including small investors who may not have access to the same level of information as sophisticated institutional investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. What is the planned timeline for implementing the new policy, and what steps will be taken to inform investors and other stakeholders about the change? How will the company address potential concerns from small investors, such as providing additional guidance or support during the transition period? Are there any estimates of the short-term market reactions to the change, and how will the company respond if there is significant volatility?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
