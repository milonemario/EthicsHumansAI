While a short-term market dip might occur as investors adjust to the new reporting, the transparency and honesty fostered by the new policy will ultimately benefit the company's reputation and sustainable growth in the long run.  The current policy, while seemingly manageable now, creates a slippery slope of potential future ethical conflicts.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deception, even if it means potentially short-term market fluctuations.  Materiality, full disclosure, and consistency are key;  investors need clear, comparable information to make informed decisions, and the company's financial statements must reflect the true economic performance, not just what might be desired by management.  The policy should withstand scrutiny and be defensible in the long term, not just in the short term.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to understand the specific methodologies used for the 50-cent upward adjustment in the current policy.  Also, what are the projected market reactions and potential investor relations strategies to address concerns about the new policy?
