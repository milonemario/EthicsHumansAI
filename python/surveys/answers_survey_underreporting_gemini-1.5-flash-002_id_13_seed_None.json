Switching to the unbiased policy aligns with good corporate governance and long-term investor trust.  While short-term market reactions might be negative,  building trust and transparency is ultimately more valuable than short-term gains achieved through manipulation.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should present a fair and unbiased representation of the company's financial performance, avoiding any intentional manipulation or misleading practices.  It should also consider the potential impact on all investor groups, not just sophisticated investors, and strive for clear and consistent communication.  Materiality is key; the policy should focus on fully disclosing information relevant to investors' decision-making.", "e6": "I'd ask about the specific strategies for communicating the policy change to investors, including plans to address concerns about potential short-term market reactions and how they'll ensure all investor types understand the new reporting approach.
