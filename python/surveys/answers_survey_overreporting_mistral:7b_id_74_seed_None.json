Even though some investors are aware of adjustments needed, it is better for the firm to move towards a more transparent, objective reporting policy that builds long-term investor trust. While change may cause some market volatility in the short term, it aligns with ethical decision-making and fosters greater accountability to stakeholders.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, objective, and truthful to investors. Any deviations from true financial performance can expose a firm to legal liability or investigations by regulatory bodies like the SEC. The current ABC company policy of over-reporting earnings per share (EPS) creates confusion and distrust among stakeholders as it must be adjusted downward by 50 cents. A new, no-bias reporting policy aligns with ethical reporting standards, promotes increased trust among investors, and reduces the firm's risk exposure. Considerating retail investors who may not fully comprehend the intricacies of corporate finance, a change to the new policy without bias would necessitate clear communication that addresses their concerns and protects them from potential exploitation by more sophisticated investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team. It's important to understand the rationale behind prioritizing a short-term focus on maintaining stock prices over long-term trust and ethical reporting standards. To promote transparency, accountability, and investor protection: 1) What are the specific risks of legal liability or investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that management is concerned about considering the current policy? 2) How does management communicate the adjustments necessary to retail investors who may not be fully aware of the over-reported earnings practice? 3) Does the board have a plan to provide transparent, clear, and accessible materials to all investors when changing to the new policy without bias, ensuring that everyone is on an even playing field during trading?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "C", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
