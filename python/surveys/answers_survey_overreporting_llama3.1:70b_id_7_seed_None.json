While some investors may initially react negatively, this change will ultimately benefit the company by reducing the risk of regulatory scrutiny and enhancing its reputation. Additionally, adopting unbiased reporting will simplify communication and eliminate concerns about misleading stakeholders. The potential short-term market reaction is manageable, and the benefits of this change outweigh the costs.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and truthfulness. It should provide stakeholders with a clear and unbiased understanding of the company's financial performance, without relying on assumptions or corrections by investors. The policy should also be consistent and predictable, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. Furthermore, an ethical reporting policy should consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, including small investors who may not have access to the same information as sophisticated investors. Ultimately, a reporting policy that values honesty and fairness will foster trust and credibility with stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask: How do you plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and stakeholders, and what measures will be taken to ensure that all investors, particularly small retail investors, are aware of the change?
