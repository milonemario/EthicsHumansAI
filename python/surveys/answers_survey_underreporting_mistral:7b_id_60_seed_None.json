Although changing this practice may initially bring market instability and potential loss in share price due to investors' expectations not being met, the long-term benefits of honest financial reporting outweigh the short-term challenges. Adopting a new policy free from bias will increase transparency, credibility, and trust with investors. Moreover, it significantly reduces legal risks associated with possible investigations by regulatory bodies. Investor relations teams can address any concerns by clearly communicating the change in financial reporting practices and educating investors.", "e5": "For a reporting policy to be ethical, it should present honest, accurate and transparent financial information that represents the actual earnings performance of the company. This ensures fairness towards its investors, avoids deception, enhances credibility, builds trust, and prevents legal implications. In this scenario, retaining a consistent bias in earnings reporting is neither transparent nor ethical, as it risks misleading investors and giving certain groups an unfair advantage for insider knowledge. Moreover, the policy should be clearly communicated to all stakeholders and avoid any actions that could negatively impact small retail investors.", "e6": "I would have several follow-up questions for the management team to probe their rationale and potential consequences further: 1) Can you quantify the impact of this earnings bias on investor returns compared to what they could have achieved if accurate financials were reported? 2) What is the potential impact on long-term trust with investors, regulators, and the market, given the consistent underreporting of EPS? 3) How will the company communicate the change in policy to retail investors without bias and minimize any potential negative effects, such as increased confusion or misinterpretation? 4) Have you explored any alternative reporting practices that accurately reflect earnings while also prioritizing both transparency and investor relations efforts?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "B", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "It is suggested that the board should adopt the new policy without bias to ensure accurate reporting and avoid potential legal liability or investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
