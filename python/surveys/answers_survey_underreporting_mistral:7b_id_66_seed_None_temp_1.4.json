Retail investors suffer enough in market imperfections; they should not be handicapped further by a company practicing deceptive accounting practices or prioritizing hedge fund interests.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should uphold legal norms, ensure investor protection and facilitate transparency to maintain public trust. The board should consider a change of the current bias in earnings reporting as it may avoid potential future legal complications and safeguard retail investors from exploitation by sophisticated hedge funds. A report presented fairly without an apparent intent to manipulate should ideally promote credibility, confidence, and long-term business success.", "e6": "The CFO has raised valid concerns about the consequences of changing the policy for both ABC and retail shareholders, but there needs to be further investigation into what steps can be taken to ensure that all investors have accurate information. I'd inquire about alternative communication strategies which highlight company values like integrity, ethical responsibility, and investor protection, explaining its commitment towards fair reporting policies.
