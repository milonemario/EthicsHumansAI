The CFO's warning that retail investors may be hurt by this change and sophisticated hedge funds would take advantage also suggests caution in adopting a new, more transparent policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy, avoiding deliberate misrepresentation or omissions that could deceive investors. It should also take into account the potential consequences of changing policies on various investor groups, aiming to minimize harm and ensure fairness. Additionally, considerations such as legal compliance, market expectations, and the company's reputation should be carefully balanced when developing and implementing reporting policies.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask follow-up questions such as: What specific steps would be taken to mitigate potential short-term market reactions and ensure a smooth transition for investors? How would the company handle situations where investors, especially retail ones, continue to assume earnings bias despite the announced policy change? Are there any plans to adjust communication strategies or investor education efforts to account for different levels of investor sophistication?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "C", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
