This could lead to negative consequences such as decreased performance and lower stock value. As a cautious and financially focused member, recommending a switch based on reported bias without anticipating these outcomes might pose significant risks", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and consistent, without any intent to mislead or deceive. The CFO's remarks on the perceived biases among investors and the potential consequences of abandoning a long-understood reporting behavior highlight a nuance often overlooked when discussing ethics in financial reporting: understanding both your own organization's interests and those of various stakeholders in managing public perceptions. A truly 'truthful' policy should reconcile an organization's interests with their social responsibility to be forthcoming, rather than attempting to placate the investors through secrecy.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions. Specifically, I'd ask the CFO and management team to elaborate on their concerns regarding potential investor reactions to a shift towards more accurate earnings reporting. Additionally, I'd inquire if they've considered gathering qualitative information from investors about their expectations and perceptions through focus groups or survey research to quantify biases and improve decision-making based on empirical data rather than intuition.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 1}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "-", "q10": "B"}
