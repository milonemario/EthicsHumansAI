Although the current policy has been tolerated by investors, it still involves reporting biased earnings, which may be seen as misleading or deceptive. The new policy eliminates this issue, ensuring that investors receive accurate information about the company's performance. While there may be short-term difficulties in communicating the change to investors, adopting the new policy is likely to benefit the company in the long run by maintaining its reputation and reducing potential risks.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and free from bias. This means that the policy should clearly disclose all relevant information about the company's financial performance without omitting or misrepresenting facts. The policy should also be consistent and fair, treating all stakeholders equally. Additionally, the policy should prioritize simplicity and clarity to avoid confusion among investors and other users of the financial reports. In the context of publicly traded companies, considerations such as compliance with regulatory requirements and adherence to industry standards are also important.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. How do you plan to communicate the change in policy to investors and other stakeholders? What are the potential costs associated with implementing the new policy, such as training for accounting staff or modifications to reporting systems? Have you considered any alternative approaches that could achieve transparency and accuracy without introducing potential disruption to the company's operations? Can you provide an estimate of when we can expect to transition to the new policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
