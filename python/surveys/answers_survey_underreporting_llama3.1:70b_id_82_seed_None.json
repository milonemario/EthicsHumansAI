While some investors may initially be surprised by the change, they will ultimately appreciate the accurate reporting. In contrast, continuing the current policy of biased reporting could lead to legal liability or reputational damage if discovered. Furthermore, adopting the new policy aligns with best practices in corporate governance and demonstrates a commitment to integrity and accountability.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and unbiased. This means that financial reports accurately reflect the company's performance without any intentional misrepresentation or omission of material facts. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should be consistent and clear in its methodology, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. Considerations such as avoiding conflicts of interest, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and being mindful of the impact on various stakeholder groups (including investors, employees, and customers) are also essential in evaluating the ethics of a reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. What is the expected timeline for implementing the new policy? How do you plan to communicate the change in policy to investors and stakeholders?
