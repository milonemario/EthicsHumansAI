The continuity of the current policy acknowledges investor awareness of the 50 cent under-reporting bias, fostering a clear commitment from the company to its existing clients. This transparency will help maintain trust and credibility with both retail and institutional investors, allowing the firm to better align their reporting policies to avoid any long lasting disadvantage.", "e5": "An ideally ethical financial reporting policy must meet several key elements to foster trust and transparency. First an understanding of market realities that acknowledges investors' ability to forecast and adjust, if necessary. Second to be credibly understood while minimizing confusion caused by significant variations in reported numbers. Finally a balanced approach ensuring consistent growth for stakeholders while maintaining legal compliance and preserving investor interests. The consideration regarding the market reaction and possible volatility experienced with retail traders and sophisticated institutional investors should also be weighed when deciding on any policy changes going forth.", "e6": "While having an understanding of the past rationale behind initiating the inconsistent earnings under-reporting, the impact that changes to this policy may have on both retail and sophisticated institutional investors merit follow-up questions.
