While the current policy may have been effective in managing expectations and stabilizing stock prices for several years, the risk of an SEC investigation or reputational damage associated with biased earnings reports outweighs any short-term benefits. By adopting a truthful approach to financial reporting, ABC Company can establish itself as a leader in corporate governance and ethics, potentially leading to long-term gains in investor loyalty and confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize truthfulness, transparency, and accuracy. It should avoid actions that could intentionally mislead or deceive stakeholders, such as investors. Considerations like investor education and awareness of potential biases can help mitigate risks, but they shouldn't justify biased reporting. A company's reputation, long-term relationships with investors, and commitment to integrity are more valuable than short-term gains from hiding true performance. Stakeholders should be able to trust the reporting policy and feel confident that the company is operating in good faith, even if its financials don't look perfect at first glance.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more context on why investors have not yet adjusted for the bias in the current policy, despite its widespread acknowledgment within the company. I would also like to know what specific steps the company plans to take to educate investors about the change in reporting policy and to build trust with them as a result of adopting a more truthful approach.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
