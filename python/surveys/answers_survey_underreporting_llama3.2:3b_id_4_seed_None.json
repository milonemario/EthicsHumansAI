This could lead to market instability and potentially harm retail investors who may not fully understand the implications of the change. The current policy allows investors to make informed decisions despite the bias, which is a better approach in my view. Changing now would be a mistake, as it's uncertain whether the benefits outweigh the potential risks and costs.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should provide shareholders with comprehensive and reliable information to make informed decisions about their investment. A policy that underreports earnings by a known amount can be seen as deceptive, even if investors anticipate the bias. An ethical policy would align transparency with honesty, allowing investors to understand all potential issues. It's also essential for a reporting policy to consider the interests of all stakeholders, including retail and institutional investors, as well as those affected by the company's operations. This approach promotes trust in financial disclosures.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions regarding the management team's understanding of how the change will be implemented and communicated to various stakeholders, including retail investors. Additionally, I'd like to know any plans for disclosing historical earnings data to provide context for the transition to a new policy and help build trust with investors. This information could help alleviate concerns about potential market volatility.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 3, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "2013 A1 (also known as C/2013A4)", "q10": "B"}
