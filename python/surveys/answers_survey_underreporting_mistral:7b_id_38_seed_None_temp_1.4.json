As retail investors are less attentive, they will continue adjusting EPS upward; large financial investments would hold benefits based on market information over smaller, individual investors as before. Implementing policies more transparently would maintain, build, and extend a fair reputation for ABC company despite minor short-term pain.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should strive for transparency, accountability, and fairness to all affected stakeholders. Key factors would include consistent, accurate reports, clear and complete disclosures, and upheld integrity in communications with investors while complying with the relevant laws of jurisdictions, as emphasized by legal counsel. Balancing short-term incentives such as higher EPS with investor confidence based on uncorrupted information, a policy that benefits minority shareholders would prioritize their investments as much as well-connected major ones. A policy should be accessible and relevant even to small, naive or less attentive investors, reducing the information gap between informed funds and the general public.", "e6": "Would you provide information on how changing to the new reporting policy would specifically harm retail investors?
