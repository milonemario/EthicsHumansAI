Changing to an unbiased policy would not only reduce potential legal liability risks but also foster trust among all stakeholders, promoting long-term growth and credibility.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, unbiased, consistent, and accurate. In this context, it is important that ABC's earnings per share do not intentionally underreport its actual performance to mislead investors. The new policy of unbiased reporting aligns with these principles, as it promotes transparency and avoids bias, regardless of how the market adjusts reported earnings. It is essential to ensure a level playing field for all investors, reduce potential legal liability risks, and foster trust among stakeholders.", "e6": "Despite the CFO's concerns, it seems vital to ask additional questions about the long-term consequences of maintaining a biased reporting policy. One question could be: 'Considering potential legal liability risks and reputation damage, would maintaining a biased reporting policy continue to provide an overall advantage in the long term compared to adopting fairer and transparent practices?'
