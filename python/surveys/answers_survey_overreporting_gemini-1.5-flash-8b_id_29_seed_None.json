The risk of a negative market reaction from investors not anticipating the change, and potentially harming retail investors, outweighs the perceived benefits of a more transparent accounting method in the current context.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should clearly communicate the accounting methods used, avoiding any ambiguity that could mislead investors.  Crucially, changes to policy should be communicated proactively and thoroughly to minimize any negative impact on investors, particularly those less sophisticated.  A policy that considers investor reactions, both positive and negative, is essential to ensure equitable treatment and market stability.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about the projected market impact of the policy change, including potential negative reactions from retail investors and sophisticated funds.
