The current policy, although well-understood by investors, is intentionally biased and may expose the company to legal liability or an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Switching to unbiased earnings reporting will eliminate this risk and align with good governance principles, ultimately benefiting the company and its stakeholders in the long run.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and consistent. The policy should provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial performance, without intentionally withholding or distorting information. Additionally, the policy should be fair to all stakeholders, including retail investors and sophisticated hedge funds, ensuring that no group has an unfair advantage. Considerations such as regulatory compliance, industry norms, and potential consequences for non-compliance are also important in evaluating the ethics of a reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and other stakeholders, and what steps they will take to ensure a smooth transition. Additionally, I would like to know if there are any potential downsides or risks associated with adopting an unbiased earnings reporting policy, and how the company plans to mitigate these risks.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (officially designated 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
