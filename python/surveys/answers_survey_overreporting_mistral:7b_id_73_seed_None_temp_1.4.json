Though it may temporarily affect market value, a truthful reporting practice aligns with the board's ethical responsibilities to provide accurate disclosures, protecting all shareholders in the long run.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy needs transparency, objectivity, truthfulness and accountability as key characteristics. In ABC's case, it is problematic that earnings are biased by 50 cents under the current policy. This raises issues regarding legal liability and investor trust as even well-informed investors have to adjust reported earnings on their end consistently. Moving towards a no-bias policy would show better accountability and improve the board\u2019s reputation for ethical conduct, protect all shareholders including retail traders in the long run, align with their legal counsel's advice, and prevent discrimination or trading advantages against certain classes of investors like hedge funds.", "e6": "Yes. A follow-up question for the management team should include seeking answers on their plans to effectively communicate and manage any potential backlash from shareholders while working towards the change, and also addressing concerns related to safeguarding retail investors from potential unfavorable market effects that could arise due to inappropriate trading practices caused by this information discrepancy.
