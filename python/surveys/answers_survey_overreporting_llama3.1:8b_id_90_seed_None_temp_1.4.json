Firstly, most investors might not comprehend and initially view the change in biased policy positively leading potentially unfavorable adjustments to EPS and perceived poor business performance in the market place. Secondly, even a well-intended new no-bias earnings per share calculation will result in current overvalued stock being undervalued once corrected EPS would be disclosed.

It must not intentionally deceive or mislead stakeholders while avoiding misleading representations, whether through omission of key information or over-emphasis of positive data.
