While investor perception may persist for some time, adopting the change will be crucial to establishing credibility as an honest and reliable company. In the long term, this will lead to increased investor trust and potentially greater returns.", "e5": "For a reporting policy to be considered ethical, transparency and integrity are essential. It should provide accurate financial data to all investors without intentional bias or manipulation. Considerations of investor sensitivity and understanding must also factor into the decision-making process: if a significant portion of the investor base remains unaware of any potential biases in the reporting, it is important to clearly communicate changes to the policy in a timely and transparent fashion. Furthermore, protecting all investors from undue harm, such as small retail investors who may be at a disadvantage compared to sophisticated hedge funds, should also be a priority when designing an ethical reporting policy.", "e6": "I would ask some follow-up questions to better understand the potential consequences and implications of changing the current reporting policy: (1) Could the board explore alternative methods to communicate the change in policy effectively, ensuring all investors are well-informed before any adjustments take place? (2) In light of the legal advisement regarding potential legal liability or investigations by the SEC, what actions can be taken proactively to address these concerns and maintain compliance with regulatory standards? (3) Given the concern for retail investors vis-\u00e0-vis sophisticated hedge funds using biased reporting to their advantage, how can we mitigate this risk in a fair manner while adhering to our ethical principles?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "A", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Responding to this scenario, one can advocate for transparency and discontinuing the current earnings under-reporting practice due to potential legal liability and detrimental effects on retail investors. However, changing to a no-bias policy might lead to short-term market rewards that could later result in punishment for lower performance due to investor adjustments. To mitigate these risks and ensure fairness, ABC could implement the new policy gradually, offering transparent communication about the change and actively educating investors on its importance.", "q10": "D"}
