While it involves underreporting earnings, investors are aware of this bias and adjust accordingly. The new policy might lead to short-term gains in perception, but it could also result in long-term penalization from savvy investors who continue to correctly anticipate the actual EPS. This potential 'reduction in earnings' could be more detrimental than the benefits gained by switching to the unbiased policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. In this context, it's critical to consider the needs of both large investors who are aware of the earnings bias and smaller retail investors who may be misled by a change in policy. An ideal policy would ensure that all stakeholders have equal access to reliable information, without creating an uneven playing field where some investors can exploit others' lack of knowledge. Additionally, it's essential to weigh the potential consequences of a policy change on investor trust, which is built over time and can be easily lost.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to communicate the change in earnings reporting policy to both large investors and retail investors, including any planned education or outreach efforts for smaller investors who may be affected by this change.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 2, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
