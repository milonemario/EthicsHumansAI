Although some investors may initially misinterpret the numbers, this short-term issue can be addressed through clear communication. The long-term benefits of unbiased reporting outweigh the potential temporary market fluctuations, ultimately contributing to a healthier and more trustworthy relationship between the company and its investors.", "e5": "I consider a reporting policy to be ethical if it is transparent, honest, and unbiased. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, without intent to mislead or deceive stakeholders. In the context of financial reporting, this means presenting accurate and unadjusted numbers, rather than using practices that require investors to make adjustments. Additionally, an ethical policy would prioritize fairness, avoiding any actions that could advantage some stakeholders at the expense of others. A consideration in this context is the potential impact on retail investors versus sophisticated institutional investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to the management team. Specifically, I would like to know more about their plan for communicating the change in reporting policy to investors and analysts, and how they intend to address any potential short-term market fluctuations that may arise as a result of the change. Additionally, I would like to understand what steps they will take to ensure that all stakeholders, including retail investors, are fully informed and able to adjust their expectations accordingly.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1), officially named 1I/'Oumuamua, a small, elongated asteroid or planetoid likely from another star system that passed within 15 million miles of the Sun on September 9, 2017", "q10": "B"}
