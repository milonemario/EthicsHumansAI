While investors have been adjusting earnings upward, the company is still under-reporting its true earnings and potentially exposing itself to legal liability or an SEC investigation. It is essential for the board and management team to communicate effectively about the change in policy and minimize potential market volatility. Retail investors should be protected from adverse effects of this policy change by providing clear, transparent communication and education about the reasons behind the shift towards truthful reporting.", "e5": "In this case, ethical characteristics of a reporting policy include honesty, transparency, and credibility. The current policy is deceitful because it involves under-reporting earnings by 50 cents which misleads investors about the true financial performance of ABC company. It lacks credibility as it relies on an assumption that investors will consistently adjust upward reported earnings. To establish an ethical reporting policy, management should prioritize transparency and avoid deceitful practices to ensure investor trust and protection. This new policy without bias would eliminate financial distortions and prevent the potential for legal liability or SEC investigation.", "e6": "Yes, I have several follow-up questions for the management team. To understand their position better, it would be helpful to know whether they have considered the long-term benefits of transparency and ethical financial reporting practices. Have they explored alternative methods to communicate the change in policy effectively, such as clear communication strategies or investor education? I would also like to ask about any steps taken to address concerns regarding protecting retail investors from potential adverse effects caused by sophisticated hedge funds trading at an advantage.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 4, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "The first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system was 'Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
