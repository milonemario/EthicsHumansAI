While there may be initial confusion among investors, clear communication and transparency through investor relations could mitigate misunderstandings, leading to a more sustainable and legally compliant approach. This shift would benefit all stakeholders by providing a more accurate financial picture and potentially preventing legal issues or regulatory scrutiny in the future.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize accuracy, transparency, and fairness. It must comply with legal standards and accounting principles, ensuring that all information disclosed is true and free from any biases or manipulations. Transparency should extend to clear communication about any changes in reporting practices to prevent misinterpretations. Fairness involves considering the impacts on all shareholders equally, including less sophisticated investors, to prevent any groups from being disproportionately disadvantaged. These characteristics ensure the reliability of financial reports and maintain trust among investors, regulatory bodies, and the public.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask how the management plans to effectively communicate the change in reporting policy to ensure all investors, especially retail investors, clearly understand the implications. Additionally, I would inquire about any strategies to mitigate potential negative market reactions and the specific steps the investor relations team will take to maintain trust and clarity in the transition period. Another critical question would involve asking for a detailed risk assessment regarding potential legal implications of continuing the current biased reporting practice.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
