The new policy, on the other hand, would eliminate a widely understood adjustment that has been in place for years, potentially causing financial difficulties for both retail and institutional investors who rely on this understanding. However, its benefits of avoiding future legal liabilities and maintaining the confidence of sophisticated investors may outweigh the short-term costs and make it the more appropriate choice.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and free from material misrepresentations. It should also consider the needs of various stakeholders, including retail and institutional investors, who may rely on consistent practices to make informed decisions. Additionally, a policy should acknowledge any necessary adjustments or departures from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in a clear and explainable manner. Further, it should demonstrate accountability for any potential consequences of misrepresentation, such as legal liabilities or reputational damage, while also prioritizing long-term integrity and trustworthiness.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more information about how they plan to communicate the change in policy to investors and ensure a smooth transition. Additionally, what measures will be taken to support retail investors who may need assistance adjusting to the new policy, given their potential reliance on the consistent practice?
