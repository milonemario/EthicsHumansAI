This creates a culture of potential future dishonesty.  While the new policy carries the risk of some misinterpretation, it's a more straightforward and transparent approach.  Given the potential for reputational damage and legal issues with the current policy, the ethical benefits of the new policy outweigh the minor risks of investor misinterpretation.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any intentional manipulation of figures to present a misleading picture of the company's performance.  Full disclosure of material information, regardless of whether it's positive or negative, is crucial.  Context matters:  how the policy affects various investor groups (retail vs. institutional), and potential impacts on the company's reputation and long-term value are significant considerations.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask about the specific anticipated investor reaction to the new policy,  the potential magnitude of the earnings adjustment that investors currently apply, and how the company plans to address and mitigate potential negative consequences for retail investors, given the potential for adverse selection. Also, how management intends to communicate the change in policy to avoid investor confusion and maintain investor trust.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
