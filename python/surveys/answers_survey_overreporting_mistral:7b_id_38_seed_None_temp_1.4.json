Communication should be adapted to address concerns regarding investor assumptions and changes in practice for consistent, credible transparency over the long term.", "e5": "An ethical financial reporting policy should be transparent and truthful, disclosing correct and accurate data to all stakeholders equally. Reporting practices must uphold legal requirements and consider the needs of underrepresented investors such as retail and small traders, who rely on publicly available reporting for decision-making. The principle of materiality is important in these decisions; any discrepancy between internal reports of earnings and external financial filings that impacts investments would not be considered ethical without reasonable caveats or transparency around any adjustments required. It is essential to address this issue cautiously, ensuring comprehensive, clear communication before changing a reporting policy for the protection and empowerment of small, retail investors in addition to maintaining the firm's reputation and stakeholder trust overall.", "e6": "The interview suggests that there is concern around both current and potential legal consequences for continued inaccurate reporting despite investor understanding. However, it also appears the concern relates to potentially negative market reaction given investor assumptions and their influence by a prior practice of misrepresentation to bolster company values. Follow-up questions for management could cover the rationale behind maintaining biased reporting up until legal intervention is threatened; plans to ensure transparency regarding any communication around changes in earnings policy to prevent further ambiguity or misunderstanding; assurance that proper disclosures and material events notifications follow applicable laws governing such communication, with prioritization of a consistent, credible approach across stakeholders; addressing investor protection implications; developing clear guidelines for internal performance tracking and evaluation using non-misleading metrics beyond EPS to better represent the company as a whole; investigating potential partnerships or external advisors to aid with communication on these matters if needed.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "In this scenario, neither changing the bias nor maintaining it is ideal due to potential investors' misinterpretation and market adjustments.

Additionally, communication efforts could focus on ensuring equal market information availability for both institutional and retail investors.", "q10": "D"}
