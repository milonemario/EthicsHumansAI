The CFO notes that they would be 'hurts' because sophisticated hedge funds would trade at an advantage against them. This potential negative impact might outweigh the benefits of a truthful reporting in earnings, considering the company's ability to raise new equity.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would be characterized by transparency, honesty, and fairness. It would clearly represent the company's actual financial performance without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. The policy should also take into account potential effects on different types of investors and ensure that no subgroup is disproportionately disadvantaged. Accountability and protection of investors' interests are paramount considerations in determining the ethical standard for a reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions. For example, What measures can be taken to inform and update retail investors about the change in policy, so they are not disadvantaged?
