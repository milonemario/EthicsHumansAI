It is essential for the board of ABC company to consider the potential legal implications, impact on investor trust, and disparities in the market when determining if the current policy is ethical or needs improvement. To make a more informed decision, relevant factors such as shareholders' interests, consistency, comparability with industry peers, and compliance with regulatory standards must be thoroughly evaluated.", "e6": "To clarify the situation further, I would request more information on the following points: Has the Securities and Exchange Commission communicated explicitly that this practice of over-reporting earnings per share may lead to investigation or legal liability?
