The current practice of over-reporting EPS may expose the firm to legal liability or an investigation by the SEC. It would be best to address any potential market confusion through clear communication about the reasons for this policy change and the benefits of honest reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should maintain transparency and accuracy in financial disclosures to uphold investor trust, protect against legal liability, and comply with regulatory requirements. It is important to report earnings without bias and provide clarity on the methodologies employed while considering potential market fluctuations and impacts on various stakeholders. The board should strive for equitable treatment of all investors by ensuring that the changes in reporting policy do not provide an unfair advantage to sophisticated investors at the expense of retail investors.", "e6": "In addition to my previous recommendations for a change in reporting policy due to ethical concerns, I would have further questions regarding investor communications and protection of retail investors. Specifically: What plan does management have in place to educate the investor community on the change to a policy without bias? How will the company mitigate potential market volatility caused by the perceived reduction in earnings? Can the firm create measures to prevent sophisticated investors from exploiting the adjustment period against retail investors?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
