Although there may be short-term consequences, such as upsetting small investors, this policy promotes long-term credibility and stability. Moreover, hiding bias from sophisticated hedge funds that understand the adjustment is unnecessary and risks drawing attention to the company's practices if changed suddenly without notice.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. Transparency involves clear and timely disclosure of financial information, allowing investors to make informed decisions. Accuracy ensures that reported figures are reliable and trustworthy. Unbiased reporting avoids intentional misrepresentation or manipulation of data. Additionally, consideration should be given to the potential impact on various stakeholders, including small investors who may not have equal access to information. A policy that prioritizes these characteristics promotes fairness, trust, and accountability in financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask: What specific steps will be taken to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and stakeholders?
