Although some investors may initially misinterpret the unbiased earnings, the benefits of accurate financial reporting outweigh the potential short-term costs. The new policy promotes integrity, accountability, and fairness, which are crucial for a publicly traded company. In the long run, it will help to maintain investor confidence, reduce the risk of legal liabilities, and enhance the company's reputation.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and consistent. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information to stakeholders, without withholding or manipulating data to mislead them. Additionally, the policy should be applied uniformly across all situations and avoid any discriminatory practices. In the context of financial reporting, this means avoiding artificial inflation or deflation of earnings, and instead presenting a true and fair view of the company's performance. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes honesty and fairness over self-interest and short-term gains.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. How do they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to stakeholders and mitigate any potential confusion or negative reaction? What specific steps will they take to ensure a smooth transition to the new policy and avoid any disruption to financial reporting? Additionally, what metrics or benchmarks will be used to measure the effectiveness of the new policy and evaluate its impact on the company's reputation and stakeholder relationships?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
