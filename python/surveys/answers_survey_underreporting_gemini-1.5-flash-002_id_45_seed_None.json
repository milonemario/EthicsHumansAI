Although the short-term market reaction may be negative, the new policy fosters transparency and avoids intentional deception.

The initial negative market reaction is a short-term cost to pay for long-term gains in reputation and trust.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids intentional manipulation or misrepresentation of financial data, even if it leads to short-term market fluctuations.  It should be consistently applied, easily understandable by investors, and disclosed clearly.  Fairness and equal access to information for all investors are crucial considerations.  The policy should also comply with all applicable laws and regulations.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific methods used to bias earnings under the old policy, a detailed plan to communicate the policy change to investors, and a risk assessment analyzing potential short-term market reactions and mitigation strategies.
