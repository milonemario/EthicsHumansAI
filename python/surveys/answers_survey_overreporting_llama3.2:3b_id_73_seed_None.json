On the other hand, more agile hedge funds and sophisticated investors will be better equipped to take advantage of the new information provided by an unbiased EPS. The potential benefits of the new policy do not outweigh the risks associated with potentially harming smaller investors who lack the necessary expertise to adjust for this new information.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, honest, and fair. It should clearly disclose any material biases or assumptions underlying the reported metrics, allowing investors to make informed decisions. The policy should also be aligned with the company's primary goals and not misleadingly distort financial performance. Furthermore, it should consider the needs of diverse stakeholders, including retail investors, who may rely on simple metrics for investment decisions, while also accounting for the expectations of more sophisticated investors. Clarity, consistency, and transparency are key in building trust with investors and maintaining a strong reputation.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to elaborate on how they plan to communicate changes to investors and other stakeholders about the transition to an unbiased EPS. Additionally, I would like to understand what specific measures will be taken to support retail investors who may need help adjusting to this new metric.
