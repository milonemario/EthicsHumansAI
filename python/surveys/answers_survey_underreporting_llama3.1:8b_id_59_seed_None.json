This outcome could harm small retail investors who rely on the previous biased reporting for their investment decisions.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should not lead to confusion among investors or create asymmetrical information where some have an unfair advantage over others. In the context of ABC's situation, an ethically sound policy would acknowledge the existing expectation among investors that EPS is inflated by $0.50, while taking steps to avoid misleading them. The goal should be to educate and reassure investors about the actual earnings performance without making unjustifiable promises or withholding information.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask: What specific steps will be taken to educate investors about the change in policy and why it was necessary? How will the company ensure that retail investors are informed about the potential consequences of the policy change, which may have a disproportionate impact on them compared to hedge funds? Are there any plans to improve transparency and communication around earnings reports and associated expectations?", "e7": "Against", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
