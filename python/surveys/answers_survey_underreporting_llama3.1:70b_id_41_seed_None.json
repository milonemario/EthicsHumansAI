Although some investors may initially be surprised or adjust their expectations, the long-term benefits of honest and unbiased reporting will foster trust with investors and enhance the company's reputation. This approach also reduces the risk of regulatory scrutiny and potential liabilities associated with biased reporting. Ultimately, adopting the new policy aligns with good governance practices and promotes a culture of transparency and accountability.", "e5": "To me, an ethical reporting policy is one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and consistency. It should provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial performance, without intentionally omitting or distorting information to influence perceptions. Considerations such as regulatory compliance, industry standards, and materiality are also important. Additionally, I believe an ethical policy should be free from bias, undue influences, and considerations that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. Ultimately, the goal of a reporting policy should be to foster trust, credibility, and informed decision-making among stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask: What specific steps will be taken to ensure a smooth transition to the new policy?
