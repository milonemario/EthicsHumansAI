Although there may be short-term challenges in communicating the change to investors, the long-term benefits of accurate and unbiased reporting outweigh these costs. The current practice of under-reporting earnings by 50 cents may be well-understood by sophisticated investors, but it still creates unnecessary complexity and potential for misunderstanding. By adopting a policy of unbiased reporting, the company can demonstrate its commitment to transparency and integrity.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. Transparency means that stakeholders can easily understand how financial performance is being reported. Accuracy ensures that reports reflect true economic reality. Unbiasedness eliminates manipulative accounting practices that may mislead investors or other stakeholders. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should consider the needs and perspectives of various stakeholders, be adaptable to changing circumstances, and align with overarching corporate values such as integrity and responsibility. Such a policy promotes trust, credibility, and fairness in financial markets.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to know how management plans to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and analysts.
