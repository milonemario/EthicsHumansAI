Although there may be some upfront inconvenience for investor relations and retail investors may suffer momentarily due to unfavorable stock price impacts, adopting this new honesty will pay dividends in terms of trust over the long term with all stakeholders while increasing transparency that ultimately makes small investors smarter about long-term sustainable performance.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should aim to present fair, unbiased information of a company's performance. It is essential to preserve trust among investors and provide transparency that supports their judgment. Characteristics of an ethical financial reporting include: accurate representation (honest), clarity and consistency overtime, alignment with generally accepted accounting principles, complete disclosure regarding material or significant issues, objectivity (non-opinion based facts), reliable verification sources & processes, proper accountability, and credibility among various stakeholders. While changing a policy to a no-bias policy may impact the perceived stock returns as investors will have to adjust their earnings assessments before investing, prioritizing openness and long-term investor interests aligns with an ethical mindset.", "e6": "I would follow up by asking the management team some questions to ensure that they understand the implications in adopting a policy with accurate no bias in financial reporting on the firm\u2019s behalf.
