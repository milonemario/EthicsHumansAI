The potential negative impact on retail investors, particularly those who may be less aware of the subtle adjustments, outweighs any short-term benefits.

This includes clearly disclosing all relevant information, avoiding biases or manipulations that could mislead investors, and maintaining a consistent approach over time. Relevance to the context is also crucial - policies should be adapted to the specific needs and risk profiles of different investor groups. Additionally, policies should strike a balance between providing valuable insights (e.g., through adjustments like the 50-cent bias) and avoiding misleading or unfairly advantageous information that could create unequal playing fields.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 RF}_{92}", "q10": "B"}
