This is likely due to the existing expectation among some investors that earnings need to be adjusted downward by 50 cents, creating an uneven playing field where sophisticated investors can gain at the expense of less informed retail investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would prioritize transparency, fairness, and honesty. It should accurately reflect the company's true financial situation without bias or manipulation. This means not artificially inflating earnings to impress investors or maintain stock prices. The policy should also ensure that all stakeholders have equal access to information, and that no group is unfairly disadvantaged due to a lack of knowledge or resources. In this context, considering the potential consequences of truthful reporting on less sophisticated retail investors would be an important factor in evaluating the ethics of the new policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask: What specific measures can be taken to educate retail investors about the change in reporting policy and ensure they are not unfairly disadvantaged?
