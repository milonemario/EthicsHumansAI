Although some investors may initially adjust their expectations, they will eventually understand that the reported earnings accurately reflect the company's performance. This approach builds trust with investors and reduces the risk of legal liability or regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, it simplifies financial analysis and decision-making for all stakeholders involved.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should provide clear and consistent information that truly reflects the company's performance, without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. Additionally, the policy should be fair and equitable, avoiding advantages or disadvantages to specific groups of investors. Considerations such as regulatory compliance, industry norms, and potential consequences for various stakeholders (e.g., impact on retail investors) are also important in evaluating the ethics of a reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to the management team. For example: What specific steps can be taken to communicate the change in policy effectively to investors and mitigate potential negative impacts on the stock price? How will the company ensure that all stakeholders, including retail investors, understand the unbiased earnings reporting? Are there any plans to provide additional guidance or supporting information to help investors adjust their expectations?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
