It's essential to report actual financial results without intentionally biasing earnings to manipulate investor perception. The policy should also consider how different groups of investors may interpret or use reported information, aiming for a fair and balanced approach that avoids exacerbating existing market inefficiencies among smaller retail investors relative to larger institutional players. Ultimately, the goal is to uphold a clear and consistent set of principles that promote trust in financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes, some follow-up questions could be useful, such as: What data or research supports the current practice of reporting biased earnings, and how do management determine when to adjust this bias?
