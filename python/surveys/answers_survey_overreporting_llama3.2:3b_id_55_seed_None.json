Changing to an unbiased policy without clear communication could lead to confusion, potentially harming small retail investors who rely on this existing understanding. Before adopting a new policy, I would recommend educating all stakeholders, including retail investors, about the change to ensure that they are not unexpectedly disadvantaged. Further analysis may be necessary to determine whether the potential benefits of the new policy outweigh the risks and costs associated with communicating the change.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and respectful of stakeholders' time and expectations. It should avoid misleading or deceiving investors by clearly disclosing material information, including any biases or adjustments. In this case, the current policy's $0.50 bias towards over-reporting earnings is a transparency issue, but it also allows investors to anticipate and adjust the numbers accordingly. An ethical reporting policy would balance clarity with the needs of different investor groups, ensuring that all stakeholders are treated fairly and can make informed decisions.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for additional information on how the management team intends to handle investor inquiries and concerns about the potential change in reporting policy.
