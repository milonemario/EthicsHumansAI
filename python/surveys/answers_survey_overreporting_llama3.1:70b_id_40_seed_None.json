Overall, the benefits of accurate financial reporting outweigh the temporary challenges associated with the policy change.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It provides stakeholders with reliable and unbiased information, allowing them to make informed decisions. Key characteristics include clear and consistent presentation of financial data, absence of intentional biases or manipulations, and adherence to relevant regulatory standards. Additionally, an ethical policy considers the potential impact on various stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, and the broader community. It also acknowledges the importance of long-term sustainability over short-term gains, and is willing to adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining a commitment to integrity.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. What communication plan is in place to inform investors and analysts about the change in reporting policy?
