The current bias may have been understood by investors, but allowing an upward adjustment based on long-standing practice, despite warnings from legal counsel, introduces unnecessary complexity and potential for misinterpretation. By adopting a bias-free approach, the company can simplify its disclosures, reduce the risk of misrepresentation claims, and strengthen its credibility with all stakeholders.", "e5": "I consider an ethical reporting policy transparent, consistent, and free from material misrepresentation. A bias-free approach aligns with these principles by providing a clear and accurate picture of the company's financial performance. Transparency is critical in maintaining trust among investors and stakeholders, while consistency ensures that comparable periods are evaluated on a level playing field. Avoiding material misrepresentation is also essential to prevent investors from being misled or undervalued. Additionally, a policy that balances the needs of all stakeholders, including retail investors and sophisticated analysts alike, can foster long-term credibility and reputation.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to request clarification on the implementation and timeline for rolling out the new policy, including any necessary training or education programs for employees to ensure consistency in its application.
