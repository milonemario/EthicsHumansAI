This creates an ethical and potentially legal risk.  The new policy, while carrying a risk of short-term investor misinterpretation, prioritizes transparency and honesty, which are crucial for long-term investor trust and company reputation.  The long-term benefits of maintaining integrity outweigh the potential short-term market fluctuations.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors through manipulation or ambiguity.  Material information must be disclosed fairly and completely, regardless of potential short-term market reactions.  The policy should also consider the impact on different investor groups, ensuring fairness and avoiding practices that could exploit less sophisticated investors.  Lastly, the policy should be consistently applied to maintain integrity and avoid any appearance of manipulation.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to understand the specific strategies the investor relations team has to communicate the change in policy to avoid negative surprises, and how they plan to mitigate any potential negative impact on retail investors.  I would also want a detailed analysis of the potential short-term market reaction, including a comparison of the expected market response to both the current policy and the proposed new policy. Finally, I would inquire about the legal implications of the current policy and the potential legal ramifications if the new policy is implemented and still perceived as deceptive.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
