While we understand the complexity of changing the current practice that has stood thus far, the potential for legal liability and market unfairness are crucial. Implementing a new policy without bias would ultimately safeguard both retail and sophisticated investor interests and enhance long-term sustainability.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should clearly present the financial performance of a company truthfully and transparently, which allows investors to make informed decisions. Relevant characteristics include complete disclosure of all relevant information in an easily understandable format, honesty and consistency in financial statements, and avoiding biased practices which would lead to deception. In this context, ensuring that the board prioritizes investor protection over short-term market gains is crucial. The CFO's concerns about potentially hurting retail investors by changing the reporting policy emphasize the need for careful consideration of stakeholder interests in implementing reporting reforms.", "e6": "In light of potential short-term volatility and the concerns raised about the effect of such a change on retail investors during market transitions, I would request for more clarification on how specific plans will be implemented to minimize impacts on investors.
