In the long term, this erodes trust and carries legal risk. The new policy promotes ethical reporting, even if it leads to temporary confusion. This builds a foundation for sustainable and trustworthy investor relationships.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy. It avoids intentional manipulation of figures, even if widely anticipated by market participants. Clear explanations of methodologies and potential influences on reported numbers are essential. The policy should also consider its impact on various investor groups, aiming to minimize unintentional harm or disadvantage to less sophisticated investors. Ultimately, ethical reporting builds trust and fosters a sustainable relationship between the company and its stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I have some follow-up questions.  \n1. How would we communicate the policy change to investors in a clear and transparent way? Could we engage with financial analysts and investor relations groups beforehand to minimize potential confusion?\n2. What is the projected impact on share price immediately following the policy change? Are there strategies to mitigate any short-term negative effects while highlighting the long-term benefits of honest reporting?\n3.
