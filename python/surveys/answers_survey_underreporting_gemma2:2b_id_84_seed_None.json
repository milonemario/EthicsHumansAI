However, the market might not react smoothly in the initial stages to this change. There is a risk of investor short-term panic and pressure for a quick comeback via the stock price movement, that ultimately causes us instability and difficulty in long term finance planning; which might also delay our ambitions. A gradual shift in reporting is likely the safest course of action, especially if we have good reason to believe that it will help our long-term growth.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy embodies transparency, honesty, and consistency. First, it adheres to clear accounting standards that are publicly verifiable, preventing manipulation or misdirection. Second, it should be straightforward and understandable for all stakeholders. Lastly, the policy must respect the principle of duty to investors by not intentionally misleading them with false hope. This ensures a fair and trustworthy environment that fosters long-term confidence in the company's management.", "e6": "I do have a few follow-up questions. Firstly, what steps will be taken to communicate this change transparently and clearly to all stakeholders? Will there be dedicated communication tools or special reports released specifically for investors to understand the new policy thoroughly? Secondly,  how will you address potential market reactions? Do you have contingency plans in place such as public statements or market-friendly disclosures to manage initial investor sentiment?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 3, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "B", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "The Oort Cloud - 1930's is what some think of in relation to 'Oort Cloud objects", "q10": "D"}
