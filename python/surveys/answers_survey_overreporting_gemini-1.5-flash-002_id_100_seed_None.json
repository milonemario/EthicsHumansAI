It presents a fair and complete picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any manipulative practices designed to artificially inflate or deflate results.  It also considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be less sophisticated and more vulnerable to misleading information.  Compliance with all applicable regulations is also crucial.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to detail their investor relations strategy for communicating the policy change.
