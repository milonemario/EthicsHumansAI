The CFO's concern about adverse market reaction, particularly harming retail investors, outweighs the potential for a smoother transition with the new policy.  The risk of investor confusion and subsequent negative market impact from an abrupt change warrants maintaining the status quo, at least for now.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors, even if unintentionally, and presents a truthful financial picture.  Crucially, it considers the impact on all stakeholders, not just sophisticated investors, and avoids policies that could disproportionately harm certain groups.  Fairness and consistency are also key components.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask the management team to quantify the potential negative market reaction to the new policy change.  Specifically, what is the projected impact on share price, investor confidence, and potential damage to retail investors, particularly in light of the equity offerings planned.  Also, how will they communicate the change in policy to ensure no misinterpretation and minimal confusion?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "1I/\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
