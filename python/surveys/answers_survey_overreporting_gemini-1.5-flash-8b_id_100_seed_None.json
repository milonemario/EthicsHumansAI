The potential 50-cent downward adjustment by investors, coupled with the impact on retail investors, suggests maintaining the current policy, despite its inherent bias, is the less risky option for the company's short-term stability and shareholder value.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It must avoid misleading investors, even if unintended, and be consistently applied.  Considerations include the potential impact on different investor groups (retail vs. institutional), the company's long-term goals, and the wider market's perception.  Crucially, the policy should be defensible as a fair and honest representation of the company's financial health.", "e6": "Yes, I'd ask for a detailed market analysis predicting the impact of the new policy on stock price, both short and long term.  I'd also want to understand the specific strategies the investor relations team has in place to communicate the change transparently and mitigate potential investor concerns.
