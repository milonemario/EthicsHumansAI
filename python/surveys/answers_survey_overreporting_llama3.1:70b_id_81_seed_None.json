Although it may lead to a short-term market correction, transparency and honesty are essential for building trust with investors. The potential risks of maintaining the current policy, including regulatory scrutiny and damage to the company's reputation, outweigh the temporary benefits. By adopting an unbiased reporting practice, the company can establish a stronger foundation for long-term success.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should provide stakeholders with a clear and complete picture of the company's financial situation, without intentionally hiding or distorting information. Considerations such as consistency, comparability, and materiality are also important. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize accessibility and understandability for all stakeholders, including retail investors. In the context of ABC, I would also consider whether the policy is in compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards, to minimize the risk of reputational damage or legal repercussions.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. How do you plan to communicate the policy change to all stakeholders, particularly retail investors? What is the estimated timeline for implementing the new policy and what are the key milestones?

Additionally, how will you ensure that your investor relations team is prepared to address any questions or concerns from analysts and investors?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "`Oumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1), discovered on October 19, 2017 by the University of Hawaii's Pan-STARRS telescope", "q10": "B"}
