Sophisticated investors, like hedge funds, may adapt quickly to the change, but others may be caught off guard and lose money. The board's ability to communicate this change in policy would also be impacted, leading to market volatility and potentially harming investors.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethically sound when it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should clearly disclose any biases or adjustments made to financial reports, enabling investors to make informed decisions. The policy should also consider the potential impact on stakeholders, including retail investors who may be disproportionately affected by changes. Additionally, a transparent and consistent reporting policy is essential for maintaining trust and confidence in the company's financial disclosures. Finally, a policy that balances competing interests, such as investor expectations with regulatory requirements, demonstrates a commitment to ethical decision-making.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask several follow-up questions to further understand the implications of changing the reporting policy. Specifically, I would like to know more about how the company plans to communicate the change to retail investors, who may be most affected, and what steps will be taken to prevent market volatility. I would also like to see more information on the process for identifying and mitigating any potential negative impacts on investors.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "2013 A1 (also known as 'Oumuamua')", "q10": "B"}
