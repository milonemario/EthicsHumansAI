While it may initially impact share prices due to confusion about the change in policy, a transparent and honest reporting of earnings would be less risky and better protect the firm from potential legal liability or investigations from regulatory bodies. Investor relations staff should communicate the change effectively to all shareholders, not only sophisticated investors, to avoid any advantage gained by certain sectors. Further education efforts could help retail investors understand the truth about earnings going forward.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should aim to present financial information accurately and transparently to investors. In the given scenario, it's clear that the current policy is biased, which could lead to legal liability or investigations by regulatory bodies. A change in policy towards providing accurate earnings without bias would ensure fair treatment to all shareholders, including retail investors, and foster trust in the firm's financials. This honesty would protect the company from potential risks and ensure long-term sustainability.", "e6": "I would ask the CFO about the potential for a phased implementation of the new reporting policy, where retail investors are informed of the change first before institutional and sophisticated investors. This could minimize any advantage gained by select groups, ensuring fair treatment to all shareholders.
