Although there are concerns about communication difficulties and the impact on small investors, a bias-free reporting policy is more transparent, ethical, and aligns with best practices in financial management. The CFO's concerns should be addressed through improved communication strategies and education of all investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize honesty, transparency, and fairness to all stakeholders. The current policy is biased and may expose ABC to legal liability or regulatory scrutiny, which could harm the company's reputation in the long run. While the current practice has been understood by investors, it is still deceptive and unethical. A new bias-free reporting policy promotes trust in the financial information provided to investors. The CFO's concerns about investor relations and retail investors should be addressed through communication strategies that clearly explain the rationale for the change in policy and ensure fair treatment of all stakeholders.
