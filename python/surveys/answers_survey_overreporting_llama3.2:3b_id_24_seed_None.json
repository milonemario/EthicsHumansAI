The new policy's potential benefits of increased transparency are outweighed by the risks of unintended consequences for retail investors, who may lose trust and suffer losses due to misunderstandings. A more careful approach would be needed to ensure that any changes to the policy do not harm vulnerable stakeholders.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes honesty, transparency, and fairness, while also taking into account the potential impact on various stakeholders. A key characteristic is ensuring that the information reported is accurate, complete, and timely, without omitting or misrepresenting relevant information. Additionally, a fair approach considers the needs of all stakeholders, including retail investors, institutional investors, and analysts. The policy should also balance compliance with regulatory requirements with the need to maintain trust with stakeholders. Finally, it should be adaptable, allowing for adjustments as circumstances change.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to gain a deeper understanding of the potential consequences of changing the policy.
