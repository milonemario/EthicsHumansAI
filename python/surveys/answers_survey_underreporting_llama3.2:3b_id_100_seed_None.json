The sophisticated hedge funds may indeed trade at an advantage against small investors, potentially creating an unfair market imbalance. Additionally, the investor relations team's ability to manage expectations and communicate the company's performance accurately could be compromised. These potential negative consequences outweigh the benefits of the new policy, making it a less attractive option for me.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and free from bias. It should enable investors to make informed decisions based on accurate information. A policy that consistently underreports earnings by a fixed amount can be seen as misleading, even if it's intended to avoid negative surprises. In contrast, a policy that discloses all relevant information upfront allows investors to adjust their expectations accordingly. Ethical reporting policies also consider the potential impact on different investor groups, including retail and sophisticated investors, and ensure that they are treated fairly and without exploitation.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to better understand the potential impact of changing the reporting policy on different investor groups. For instance, what specific steps would be taken to ensure that retail investors are not unfairly disadvantaged by the change? How would the company's investor relations team adapt to communicate the new information in a way that is transparent and effective for all investors?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "1O-Tombugini", "q10": "B"}
