In this case, it is important to consider the investors' best interests as well as legal liabilities and potential investigations by regulatory bodies. While consistent overreporting has been understood by some in the investor community, such a practice still exposes the firm to risks that could negatively impact its reputation, financial standing, and compliance with securities regulations. To promote transparency and fairness, it is crucial for ABC to switch to a new policy in which earnings are reported without bias.", "e6": "It is concerning to hear that the current practice may expose ABC to legal liability or an investigation by the SEC. While it is understandable that investors have recognized and adjusted reported earnings due to the firm's consistent over-reporting, it is essential for the company to adopt a policy with unbiased earnings reporting to comply with regulations and maintain its reputation as a safe investment.
