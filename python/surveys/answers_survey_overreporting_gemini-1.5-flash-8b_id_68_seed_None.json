It avoids any form of deception or manipulation, even if seemingly beneficial in the short term.

I would ask about the specific projected impact of the new policy on stock price, particularly in the short term.  I'd also want to know what measures are in place to mitigate potential harm to retail investors and how the company plans to communicate the change to investors to minimize negative reactions.  Finally, I'd inquire about alternative strategies to maintain a strong stock price that don't rely on potentially misleading earnings reports.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
