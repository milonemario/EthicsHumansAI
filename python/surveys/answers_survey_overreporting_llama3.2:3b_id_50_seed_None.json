While the current policy may be seen as dishonest or deceptive, changing to the new policy requires investors to mentally adjust for the historical bias. This could potentially harm retail investors who are less vigilant and may lead to market fluctuations. On the other hand, the new policy promotes transparency and honesty. As a board member, I would recommend conducting thorough research and consulting with various stakeholders, including retail investors, to determine the best course of action that minimizes potential negative consequences.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it promotes transparency, honesty, and fairness. A key characteristic is that it aligns reported metrics with true performance, allowing for informed decision-making by stakeholders. Additionally, the policy should be clear, concise, and easily understood by all parties involved. Furthermore, it should be free from bias and manipulation, taking into account the needs of different investor groups, such as retail investors who may not possess specialized knowledge or expertise. This ensures that everyone has access to accurate information, enabling them to make informed decisions.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask additional clarifying questions to better understand the potential impact of changing the reporting policy on retail investors. For example: What steps are in place to educate retail investors about the change in policy? How will you mitigate potential losses or disruption to investor portfolios as a result of this change? What alternative measures can be implemented to ensure that all stakeholders have access to accurate and comparable information?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2008 TC3", "q10": "B"}
