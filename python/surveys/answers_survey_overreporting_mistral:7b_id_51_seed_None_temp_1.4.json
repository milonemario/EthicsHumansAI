Addressing these concerns can help mitigate potential legal and reputational risks, while safeguarding smaller retail investors against misuse from sophisticated institutional traders. The CFO's team should work in collaboration with financial communication experts to effectively communicate this policy change to stakeholders, thus quelling market volatility and providing greater transparency without the deception.", "e5": "The ethical characteristics of a reporting policy for ABC Company should revolve around transparency, accuracy and honesty while addressing relevant considerations such as protecting small investors, maintaining integrity to legal requirements, and promoting fairness as per industry practices. These measures must also support a positive long-term relationship with stakeholders built on trust without manipulating market sentiment. Given the context provided in case, the proposed lack of bias by reporting EPS can foster greater transparency and avoid exposure to potential risks related to investigations or legal liability while empowering retail investors and safeguarding them from hedge fund disadvantage exploitations.", "e6": " As a member of ABC's Board, I would question the CFO and top management team regarding: 1) the potential risks imposed by continued bias on the financial reporting, such as regulatory investigations and the effects on the company image, alongside associated legal costs. 2) Alternatively, should there be a phased approach for this new EPS reporting policy implementation without bias to minimize unfavorable market reactions due to decreased earnings expectations among investors while still maintaining effective investor communication. This method would create clarity through transition and demonstrate long-term diligence.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "E", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "The question focuses on financial decisionmaking, overstated earnings reports, market expectation and its impact.
