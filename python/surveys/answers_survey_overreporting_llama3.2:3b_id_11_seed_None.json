Changing to the new policy would require careful consideration of how investors would react and whether the added transparency is worth any potential harm to smaller investors who rely on the perceived bias in earnings reports. A thorough analysis of these factors would be necessary to inform a board decision.", "e5": "A reporting policy can be considered ethical if it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should avoid misleading or deceiving stakeholders by presenting reliable information that is not biased or manipulated. Additionally, the policy should consider the interests of all investors, including retail and institutional shareholders. In this context, the current policy's bias may create an uneven playing field, where sophisticated investors can take advantage of smaller ones. An ideal reporting policy would provide clear guidance on how to interpret financial results, reducing potential conflicts of interest and maintaining trust in the company's disclosures.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask additional questions such as: What steps will be taken to educate both small and sophisticated investors about the change in reporting policy? How will the company ensure that retail investors are not unfairly disadvantaged by the removal of the earnings bias?
