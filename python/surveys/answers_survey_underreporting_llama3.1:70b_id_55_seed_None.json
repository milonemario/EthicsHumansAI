Although some investors may initially misinterpret the change, it ultimately aligns with good governance and reduces potential legal liability. Additionally, a bias-free reporting policy facilitates more accurate assessment of the company's performance by analysts and investors. In the long run, this transparency can lead to increased trust in management and enhanced credibility for the firm.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial performance without relying on assumptions or adjustments. Additionally, consideration should be given to the potential impact on various investor groups, including small investors who may not have equal access to information. In this context, I also consider it important for the policy to be consistent and reliable over time, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on a clear understanding of the company's financial situation.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. What is the expected timeline for implementing the new policy and how will it be communicated to stakeholders?
