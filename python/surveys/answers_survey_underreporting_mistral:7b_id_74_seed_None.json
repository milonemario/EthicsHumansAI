Additionally, protecting retail investors from being taken advantage of by hedge funds is essential. Therefore, a change to the new policy would be recommended.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, reliable and consistent. It is essential that financial reports accurately reflect a company's actual performance to ensure fairness and trust among investors. The current policy lacks transparency as the earnings are biased, introducing uncertainty in investor decision making. Further, it appears that the practice of underreporting was initiated without regard for potential harm to retail investors, who may not have the same access to information as sophisticated hedge funds. A new policy without bias would promote fairness and trust amongst investors by allowing for accurate evaluation of a company's performance. Additionally, it is important to consider long-term viability, as maintaining transparency and ethical financial reporting will create a more stable foundation for growth.", "e6": "In this scenario, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. Firstly, to clarify any potential legal implications associated with the current practice of underreporting earnings per share. Secondly, to ask for more insight into the feasibility of credibly communicating the change in policy while still accounting for investor expectations and market reactions. Lastly, to request a comparison between retail investors' losses versus any benefits gained by the company or senior management over time due to maintaining this practice.
