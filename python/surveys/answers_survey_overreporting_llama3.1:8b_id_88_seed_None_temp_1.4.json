It should not prioritize temporary gains over long-term integrity, such as concealing problems for favorable short-term stock prices. The policy should be transparent, with clear expectations for readers, and adaptable to changes in the investor climate while keeping to factual accuracy. Considerations, like market fluctuations or public reaction, should not compromise fundamental honesty.", "e6": "Yes.
