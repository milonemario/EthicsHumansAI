Although it may cause short-term market volatility, it aligns with accounting standards and reduces the risk of legal liability. Additionally, it treats all investors equally by providing them with the same information, rather than relying on their ability to adjust for the bias. This decision prioritizes long-term credibility and integrity over potential short-term gains.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means providing clear and comprehensive information that reflects the company's true financial situation, without omitting or manipulating data to influence stakeholder decisions. Additionally, an ethical policy should be consistent and easily understandable by all stakeholders, regardless of their level of expertise or access to information. Considerations such as fairness, honesty, and respect for investors' rights are also essential. Furthermore, policies that prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains, and consider the potential impact on vulnerable stakeholders, demonstrate a strong ethical foundation.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. Firstly, what specific steps will be taken to communicate the change in policy to investors and stakeholders? Secondly, how will the company ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential disruptions to its operations and market price? Thirdly, what measures will be put in place to protect vulnerable stakeholders, such as retail investors who may not have access to the same information as institutional investors? Lastly, how will the company monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the new policy over time?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
