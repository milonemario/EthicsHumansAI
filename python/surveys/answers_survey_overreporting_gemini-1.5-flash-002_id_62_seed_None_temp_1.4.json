The potential for temporary negative market response is outweighed by the ethical imperative of unbiased reporting.  Addressing investor concerns through clear communication about the policy change will mitigate the negative impact.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness.  It should present a complete and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any intentional manipulation or misleading information.

It should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups and strive to avoid creating unfair advantages.", "e6": "I'd ask for a detailed communication plan to address the anticipated market reaction to the policy change.
