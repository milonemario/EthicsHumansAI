While short-term resistance to change is understandable, it would be in the long-term best interests of the company to transition to a new policy with unbiased earnings reporting. The board should collaborate with the CFO to ensure clear communication about the policy change and educate investors on the new EPS framework.", "e5": "An ethically sound financial reporting policy is one that guarantees accurate, unbiased, complete representation of a company's earnings. To maintain investor confidence and comply with laws and regulations\u2014as mentioned by legal counsel\u2014a company should adhere to transparency in earnings reporting. It is essential not just for the investors but also for protecting the interests of stakeholders and ensuring long-term value creation, rather than engaging in deceptive or manipulative tactics aimed at generating artificial short-term returns. Moreover, it is critical for public traded companies like ABC to prioritize building trust with sophisticated institutions and retail investors alike to secure stable financing without exploiting price differences due to superior information or knowledge.", "e6": "It is crucial to delve further into several key concerns when considering the proposed change in reporting policy. To ensure transparency and ethical decision-making, the board should first address the underlying issue of why earnings are consistently under-reported. Is it due to a flaw in accounting practices or prior mismanagement? Additionally, I would encourage engaging external financial experts and legal counsel to collaborate on a strategy for effectively communicating the change in policy to all investors, addressing concerns related to market volatility and potential market advantage exploitation. Furthermore, to ensure fairness to retail investors, an enhanced investor education program about the financial reporting process could be implemented to empower them with knowledge of unbiased metrics for informed investment decisions.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "A", "q4": "A", "q5": "B", "q6": "D", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "The first interstellar object identified passing through our solar system was the 'Oumuamua", "q10": "C"}
