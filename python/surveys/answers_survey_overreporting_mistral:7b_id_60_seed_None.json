Although the investor community may initially struggle with correcting their assumptions or adjusting their investment strategies, maintaining the current policy exposes the company to greater legal risk and could harm small investors by enabling larger players to exploit the inequity in financial reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, unbiased, and honest. It should present accurate financial information to stakeholders in a way that allows them to make informed decisions about investments or transactions without undue influence. In this context, the current policy of ABC company raises concerns due to its practice of over-reporting earnings per share (EPS) by 50 cents despite it being well-understood by the investor community. This may expose the firm to legal liability and potential investigations by regulatory bodies, which jeopardizes trust in the company. A policy without bias would help improve transparency and accountability for the board, minimize the risk of market manipulation, and maintain investor confidence over time. While retail investors might suffer some short-term disadvantages upon implementing this change, it is crucial to prioritize long-term ethical values and level the playing field among all stakeholders.", "e6": "I would request clarification on what steps are being taken to ensure an effective communication strategy that emphasizes the change in financial reporting policy and addresses concerns about equity offerings, potential market volatility, and the impact on retail investors. Additionally, I would invite a representative from legal counsel to weigh in on the possible risks associated with not revising the current policy due to potential SEC investigations or liability.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "The question does not relate to the information provided, and there is no need to provide an answer.", "q10": "B"}
