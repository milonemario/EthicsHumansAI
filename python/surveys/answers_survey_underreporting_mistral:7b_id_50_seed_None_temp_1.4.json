First, retroactively disclosing adjustments for earnings may be met with suspicion and criticism from investors. Second, the market might penalize the company in the short term if investors continue to make upward earnings adjustments that are now no longer applicable. Third, this decision could disadvantage small retail investors by giving sophisticated investors an advantage. While the current practice is not ideal due to its deceptive nature, it does currently satisfy investor demand while maintaining a consistent share price. The current CFO also shares significant concerns about how abrupt changes can detrimentally affect the less-savvy market participants such as retail investors. Therefore, the recommendation would entail further investigation into minimizing or gradually transitioning away from the current practice with better transparency, clarity of future policy communications and education for the retail investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should aim to represent the company's financial position truthfully and accurately. The considerations in this scenario are transparency, fairness, compliance with legal requirements, investor protection, and minimizing market disruptiveness. The current practice of under-reporting earnings carries inherent risks for legal liability, investigation, and loss of trust from investors. Transitioning to unbiased reporting may have short-term challenges but ultimately aligns with the company's objectives of maintaining integrity and investor trust. Addressing potential market disruptions through education, communication and gradually implementing the change could help protect less experienced investors. Lastly, prioritizing fairness in information availability across all market participants is necessary to avoid an unfair advantage for sophisticated investors over retail ones.", "e6": "Additional questions for management team could include seeking elaboration on potential strategies to minimize short-term market risk associated with changing policies, exploring options for educating and assisting retail investors in understanding adjusted earnings, discussing communication plans for current investor relations team for implementing the no-bias policy and outlining potential advantages and impacts of this changeover time.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "As provided, I cannot respond to questions irrelevant to this case scenario.", "q10": "D"}
