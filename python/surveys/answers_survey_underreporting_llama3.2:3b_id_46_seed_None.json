However, it may also lead to short-term volatility and increased scrutiny from investors, including sophisticated hedge funds. To mitigate these risks, the board should carefully communicate the reasons for the change and provide guidance on how investors can adjust their expectations. Additionally, the board should ensure that the company's investor relations team is equipped to handle potential market reactions and maintain credibility with retail investors.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical when it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. Ethical policies should clearly disclose material information, avoid biases that mislead investors, and provide context for understanding financial results. In addition, policies should be free from self-serving or special-interest influences that could distort the truth. In the case of ABC Inc., a policy that consistently under-reports earnings would raise concerns about ethics due to its potential impact on retail investors who may not understand or adjust for the bias. An ethical policy would prioritize full disclosure and unbiased reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions to clarify the potential impact of changing the policy on investor relations and retail investors.
