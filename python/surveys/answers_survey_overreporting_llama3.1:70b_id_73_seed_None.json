Although some investors may initially misinterpret the change, it ultimately promotes a more honest and reliable representation of the company's earnings. This reduces the risk of legal liability or regulatory investigation, which could have severe consequences for the company. By adopting the new policy, ABC demonstrates its commitment to integrity and responsible business practices, maintaining trust with investors and stakeholders.", "e5": "I consider a reporting policy ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial situation without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. Additionally, an ethical policy would prioritize consistency and comparability, allowing investors to make informed decisions. In the context of ABC, it is also important to consider fairness to all investors, regardless of their level of sophistication or access to information, to prevent any group from being unfairly disadvantaged.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team. How do they plan to communicate the change in policy to investors and stakeholders? What steps will be taken to ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential disruption to the stock price?
