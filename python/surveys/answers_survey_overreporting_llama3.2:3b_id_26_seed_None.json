While the new policy aligns with honesty and transparency, I believe the short-term costs outweigh the long-term benefits, and maintaining the status quo is the more prudent decision.", "e5": "A reporting policy is viewed ethically when it prioritizes transparency, honesty, and accuracy above its potential effect on investor expectations or stock price. It should be free from biases that could mislead investors about a company's financial performance. In this context, adjusting reported earnings downward by $0.50 may be seen as a form of 'good news' bias, which can influence investor decisions and potentially lead to market volatility. An ethical policy would consider this potential impact and strive for clarity and consistency in reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team, specifically regarding how they plan to address potential concerns about the new policy's impact on market volatility and retail investors. Additionally, I would ask about plans for communication with investors about the change in policy, including educating retail investors who may not be aware of the historic bias in earnings reports and their expectations.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Siding Spring)", "q10": "B"}
