The current policy, despite being deceptive, seems to have a more predictable outcome within the existing framework.  Therefore, maintaining the current policy, despite its flaws, is likely the safer choice for now.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, presenting financial information honestly and without bias.  It must consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the wider public.  Fairness, avoiding manipulation, and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles are crucial.  The policy should also address how to manage potential conflicts of interest and ensure consistent application over time.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask for a detailed market analysis projecting the potential negative reaction to the policy change, including quantifiable impacts on share price and potential investor losses.  I'd also want to know the specific actions the investor relations team will take to communicate the change to the market and address concerns from retail investors.  Finally, I'd seek input on alternative strategies for maintaining investor confidence while adopting a more ethical policy.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
