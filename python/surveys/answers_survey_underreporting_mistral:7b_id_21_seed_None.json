While it may have been accepted by the investor community in the past, it exposes ABC to legal liability and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The board should take this legal risk seriously and change to a new policy that eliminates the bias in financial reporting. It may be difficult for the investor relations team to initially communicate the change, but long-term benefits would exceed short-term consequences. The market will eventually adjust to the unbiased earnings, reducing competitive disadvantages against hedge funds. Moreover, it is important to safeguard retail investors from being taken advantage of by more aware and sophisticated financial players.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should provide authentic, accurate, and transparent financial information to all investors. The current practice of under-reporting EPS by 50 cents is clearly in violation of this principle as it misrepresents ABC's true earnings performance and could lead to legal consequences and harm investors. An ethical reporting policy would be straightforward, easily understood, and avoid deception by providing a clear picture of the company's financial position, even if it results in potential short-term market volatility and some competitive disadvantage against more sophisticated players. Ethical considerations include equity fairness across all types of investors\u2014retail or institutional\u2014and consistent application to avoid creating an unfair playing field in the financial markets.", "e6": "It is important to clarify a few concerns with the management team. First, I would ask if there is any potential risk of legal action or regulatory investigation due to the practice of under-reporting EPS by 50 cents. Second, it would be valuable to know if the company has considered the long-term benefits for investors from an unbiased reporting policy, such as increased trust and transparency and reduced competitive disadvantages against sophisticated players. Lastly, I would inquire about any plans or strategies for communicating the change to the investor community in a credible and transparent manner. This is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and ensuring that all investors receive equal access to accurate financial information.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "This question does not pertain to the first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system.", "q10": "D"}
