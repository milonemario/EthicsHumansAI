This could lead to market volatility and harm to smaller investors. In contrast, the current policy provides a clear understanding of the earnings bias, allowing investors to make informed decisions. Sticking with the current policy balances transparency with a consistent indication of earnings bias, mitigating the risk to retail investors while still being transparent about the bias.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical if it prioritizes transparency, honesty, and clarity while also considering the needs and expectations of various stakeholders. This includes clear disclosure of any biases or modifications to financial reports, as well as providing context that enables investors to make informed decisions. Additionally, a policy should ensure that all stakeholders are treated fairly and without deception, regardless of their sophistication level. By balancing these considerations, a reporting policy can maintain trust and credibility with investors while also supporting the company's long-term sustainability and reputation.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask additional questions about how the company plans to address concerns over potential misinterpretation of the new policy among smaller investors and what safeguards are in place to prevent exploitation by sophisticated hedge funds.
