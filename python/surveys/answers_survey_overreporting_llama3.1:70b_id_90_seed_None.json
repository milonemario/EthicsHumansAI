Although the current policy has potential legal liability, it is well-understood by investors who adjust for the bias. The CFO's concerns about credible communication of the change are valid, and a smooth transition may be challenging. Therefore, the benefits of changing to an unbiased reporting policy do not outweigh the potential risks and negative consequences for investors at this time.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should clearly disclose its methodology and assumptions, allowing investors to make informed decisions. Additionally, the policy should be consistent and not intentionally misleading. In the context of ABC's situation, considerations such as the impact on retail investors and the potential for short-term stock price volatility are also important. An ethical reporting policy would balance the need for accurate financial information with the need to protect vulnerable stakeholders, such as retail investors. Fairness and honesty should be guiding principles in developing a reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team. Specifically, I would ask: What is the potential magnitude of short-term stock price volatility if we switch to the new policy? How do you plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to retail investors and other stakeholders? Are there any alternatives or compromises that could be explored to address concerns about bias in reported earnings while minimizing disruption to the business? How would you measure the success of a transition to the new policy, and what metrics would be used to evaluate its effectiveness?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua)", "q10": "B"}
