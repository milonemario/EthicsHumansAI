The CFO's concern about investor perception and potential harm to retail investors outweighs the benefits of transparency.  Maintaining the current policy, despite its inherent deception, appears to be the less damaging choice for the company in the short term.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors through manipulation or omission, even if it might seem beneficial in the short term.  Full disclosure, appropriate context, and a clear understanding of the reporting framework are crucial for investor trust and long-term sustainability.  The potential impact on various stakeholders\u2014including retail investors, institutional investors, and the overall market\u2014must also be a key consideration.", "e6": "Yes.  I would want to understand the projected market reaction to the change in policy, a detailed analysis of the impact on different investor segments (retail vs. institutional), and a plan to mitigate potential negative consequences.
