The current policy, although well-understood by investors, has the potential to mislead some investors who may not be aware of the bias. Additionally, maintaining an unbiased reporting practice reduces the risk of legal liability or regulatory investigation. This change aligns with best practices and supports the company's long-term reputation for integrity and trustworthiness.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and unbiased. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information to stakeholders, without attempting to mislead or manipulate them. It's also important for the policy to be consistent and fair, avoiding cherry-picking of data or selectively disclosing information that presents the company in a favorable light. Furthermore, the policy should prioritize accuracy and reliability over short-term gains or avoidance of negative surprises. In the context of financial reporting, this means prioritizing GAAP compliance and avoiding aggressive accounting interpretations that may obscure the true financial picture.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to communicate the change in policy to investors and analysts, including any planned disclosures or explanations. Additionally, I would like to understand what steps the company will take to ensure that all stakeholders, including those with less sophisticated understanding of financial reporting, are adequately informed about the impact of the changed policy on their decision-making. Finally, I would ask for clarification on how the company plans to monitor and adjust its communication approach as needed.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
