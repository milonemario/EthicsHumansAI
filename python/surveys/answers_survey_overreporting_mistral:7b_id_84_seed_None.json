Given the current policy's potential legal liability and the investors' misconception of the firm's actual EPS, changing to the new policy without bias is recommended. Alleviating these concerns will also encourage long-term trust from investors, fostering a stronger relationship.

This transparency fosters trust among stakeholders, ensuring the credibility of the company and safeguarding it from potential legal liability or investigations by regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. The policy should prioritize honesty and ensure that no misleading statements are made to investors, thereby guaranteeing fair treatment for all parties involved in the market. Though changing to an unbiased earnings reporting strategy may cause concern regarding a perceived decrease in performance and potential short-term losses, maintaining such a practice offers long-term benefits through ethical operation and trust from investors.", "e6": "To clarify the concerns mentioned by the CFO, I would request for more detailed information regarding their assumptions about retail investors' understanding and reaction to the change in policy.
