While changing may impact near-term stock trajectory due to investors adjusting earnings, long-term benefits would include increased trust, levelized playing field across all types of investors by avoiding misguidance, diminished risk of legal action, and potential expansion of investor base by showcasing commitment to integrity.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should disclose accurate, transparent, and comprehensive information to shareholders, ensuring level-playing field for all investors while considering relevant regulations. Transparency is paramount in providing trust, credibility, and promoting informed financial decision-making. The current practice of ABC underreporting EPS by 50 cents could be misleading to retail investors, especially given the possibility of legal risks and investigation. Additionally, upholding social responsibility requires the protection of vulnerable smaller investors from being exploited by sophisticated ones. Therefore, ethical considerations should also focus on a policy that is fair towards all stakeholders.", "e6": "As a board member, I have several follow-up questions. Firstly, how does management intend to ensure adequate communication with retail investors while implementing the new reporting policy and disclosing the rationale behind the underreported earnings by current management? Secondly, does the management possess any relevant data that demonstrates how often small retail investors would incur significant losses due to inadequate anticipation of the upward 50-cent adjustment under no bias reporting policy? Moreover, given the possible legal liability and an investigation by SEC associated with earnings biased policies, I am concerned about the risk mitigation measures in place to protect ABC. Finally, as growth depends upon shareholder trust, could management articulate specific ways of measuring shareholder confidence throughout the transition to eliminate-bias reporting, including strategies for ensuring transparency and preserving investor relations credibility?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumiuewne K1 (\u2018Oumuamua\u2019)", "q10": "A"}
