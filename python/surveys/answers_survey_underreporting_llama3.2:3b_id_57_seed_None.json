The current policy has been in place for years, and its benefits have been well understood by sophisticated investors who can adjust accordingly. Changing the policy could create unintended consequences, such as increased volatility or negative market reactions, which may outweigh any potential benefits of reporting unbiased earnings.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and fair. It should provide clear guidance to all stakeholders on what information is being reported and why. In this case, maintaining the bias adjustment policy allows sophisticated investors to adjust their expectations accordingly, while small retail investors understand the customary adjustment. The policy should not mislead or deceive investors. Additionally, it's essential to consider the company's compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards. An ethical reporting policy also balances competing interests, such as the need for accurate financial reporting vs. avoiding negative market reactions.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team follow-up questions to better understand their concerns and the potential implications of switching to an unbiased reporting policy. Specifically, I would like to know more about how they plan to educate small retail investors about the change, how they will mitigate any negative market reactions, and what measures they have in place to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, I would like to hear their strategy for maintaining investor trust through transparent communication and regular reporting of key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the adjustment's impact.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 4, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2013 A1 (also known as 'Oumuamua'}", "q10": "B"}
