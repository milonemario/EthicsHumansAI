Switching to the new, unbiased policy demonstrates commitment to transparency and builds trust with investors. While there might be an initial negative market reaction, the long-term positive impact on the company's reputation and investor confidence far outweighs the short-term costs.  Transparency and ethical behavior are essential for long-term success.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and unbiased.  It avoids any intentional manipulation or misrepresentation of financial data, regardless of short-term market impacts.  It fairly presents all material information, providing context to help investors understand the company's performance and avoid misinterpretations.  The policy's communication to investors should be clear, timely, and consistently applied.  Consideration must also be given to the potential impact of the policy on different investor groups, striving for equitable treatment.", "e6": "I would ask about the plan to communicate the policy change to investors, addressing potential concerns and misconceptions. I'd also ask for a detailed analysis of potential short-term market impact and strategies to mitigate any negative consequences.
