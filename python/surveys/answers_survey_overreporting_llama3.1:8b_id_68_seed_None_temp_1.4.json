This is especially true since some may not understand this reduction from previous biases. A more practical consideration is that the firm has traditionally relied on these biased reporting practices without negative consequences; as such implementing change (new unbiased policy) might harm stakeholders more so than simply continuing to bias EPS under cover (with prior management's agreement) while reassuring no one outside will be fooled by expected stock market performance which, from previous history is unlikely to get challenged.", "e5": "An ethical policy, from my perspective would be one where information is presented clearly and accurately. This might involve not inflating reported values when consistently understood by the investing public in an opposite direction - as this effectively implies certain financial characteristics known are somewhat fabricated for a period to keep a desired perception through bias while keeping true investors well informed of changes after reporting that there seems no evidence any stock price moved accordingly due over biased inflation of current reported earnings. Transperancy, clarity and avoiding deceptive methods seem highly relevant especially when considering future performance evaluations.", "e6": "Yes.
