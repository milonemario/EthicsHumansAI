While some investors may initially be negatively impacted by lower perceived earnings, the long-term benefits of increased credibility and trust with retail investors will likely outweigh any short-term losses. Furthermore, the CFO's concerns about sophisticated hedge funds being able to adjust for the bias are mitigated by the fact that they would have always done so under the old policy. Ultimately, a more transparent and honest approach is essential for long-term success and reputation.", "e5": "A reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should provide timely and accurate information to stakeholders, allowing them to make informed decisions. The policy should also consider vulnerable populations, such as retail investors, who may be disproportionately affected by biases or inaccuracies. Additionally, the policy should balance competing interests, like maintaining competitiveness with being overly aggressive in reporting earnings. Finally, a reportings policy should undergo regular review and revision to ensure it remains aligned with changing market conditions and societal values.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions about how the management team will ensure that retail investors are not unfairly impacted by the new policy.
