The new policy, while honest, risks creating confusion and potentially disadvantageing less sophisticated investors unfamiliar with the prior reporting practices. This could lead to unforeseen market reactions and erode trust in the company.  ", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy. It should provide investors with a clear, unbiased view of the company's financial performance, enabling them to make informed decisions. This means avoiding intentional manipulation of figures and clearly communicating any methodologies or assumptions used in financial reporting.  Furthermore, ethical considerations extend beyond legal compliance. A company should strive to minimize potential harm to all stakeholders, including less sophisticated investors who may be more vulnerable to misleading information.", "e6": "Yes, I would have some follow-up questions: \n1. What are the specific legal risks associated with continuing the current policy? Have we received any formal warnings or inquiries from regulators?\n2. Could we develop a phased approach to transitioning to the new policy, perhaps by providing more detailed explanations of our accounting methodologies and gradually reducing the bias over time?\n3. How can we effectively communicate the change in policy to all investors, ensuring that smaller retail investors understand the rationale behind the transition?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "'Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
