Though changing to unbiased reporting will necessitate transparent communication and require vigilance against potential negative market reactions, it will instill trust and confidence in financial transparency needed for future success.", "e5": "Ethical financial reporting characteristics would prioritize truthfulness, transparency, fairness, accountability and legal regulation considerations. This involves accurately recording all events in a period in a timely fashion through consistent standards without manipulation; providing accessibility to all information including the impact of certain items on the financial statements; treating all stakeholders equally by addressing each group's needs; acknowledging any errors in a timely and forthright manner; and abiding by applicable laws, regulations, principles and professional criteria. Relevant context considerations for ABC company involve the consistent over-reporting of its EPS by 50 cents for many years that hides true financial performance and exposes the corporation to legal liability while also perpetuating a situation where small retail investors could lose their confidence in investor communications, making unbiased reporting essential as it would provide equitable information availability.", "e6": "I would want to understand the potential long-term impact of the current policy on maintaining investor trust and corporate credibility given continuous earnings biased reporting for years, despite it not really misinforming investors.

In answering, I can refer you to key points from the text to consider for a comprehensive response: The inconsistency of reporting earnings vs reality may lead to legal or regulatory complications as well as mistrust among some investors. Retail shareholders are exposed to potential harm if adjustments are not made due to their dependence on reported data, and large traders may exploit such practices to gain advantages over them. In a decision-making context, these outcomes raise ethical, moral and prudential concerns that outweigh the potential temporary advantages of maintaining a biased reporting strategy.", "q10": "D"}
