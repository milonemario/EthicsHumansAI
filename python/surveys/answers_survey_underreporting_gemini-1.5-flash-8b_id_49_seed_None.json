Transparency and honesty are paramount.  While some investors might react negatively initially, the long-term benefits of a credible and ethical reporting approach outweigh the risks.  The current policy is fundamentally misleading, and a shift to an unbiased system, even with initial market uncertainty, is the preferable path.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors, whether intentionally or unintentionally, by clearly and truthfully reflecting company performance.  Contextual factors, like the company's long-term goals and investor sophistication, influence the optimal balance between timely communication and complete disclosure.  Ultimately, the policy should foster trust and confidence in the company's leadership and financial reporting, not generate short-term gains at the expense of long-term credibility.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the change in policy to investors, and how they will address potential concerns.  Further, I would want to understand how the company's retail investors are being considered in this transition and what steps are in place to help them adjust.  Finally, what contingency plans are in place to mitigate any significant negative market reaction to the policy change?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
