The current policy, although well-understood by some investors, can still be seen as deceptive or manipulative. By adopting an unbiased reporting practice, ABC company promotes a culture of integrity and accountability, which can lead to long-term benefits such as improved reputation, reduced regulatory risks, and increased investor confidence.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should provide a clear and truthful representation of the company's financial performance, without any intention to mislead or deceive stakeholders. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should be consistent, reliable, and compliant with regulatory requirements. In the context of ABC company, consideration should also be given to the potential impact on retail investors who may not have the same level of sophistication as institutional investors. Overall, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes fairness, honesty, and accountability.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. Firstly, what is the proposed timeline for implementing the new reporting policy and how will it be communicated to stakeholders? Secondly, how do you plan to address potential negative reactions from investors who may not understand or appreciate the change in policy? Thirdly, what measures are being taken to ensure that all employees, especially those in investor relations, are equipped to clearly explain the company's financial performance under the new reporting framework? Finally, what metrics will be used to monitor the effectiveness of the new policy and make adjustments as necessary?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
