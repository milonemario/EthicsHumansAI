While changing the reporting policy would initially cause confusion, its transparency ultimately benefits the ABC company as investors appreciate open communication that protects market confidence in the long run. By raising new equity, this transition should be acknowledged and clearly communicated so small retail investors are not affected by arbitrager strategies based on inconsistent EPS reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should accurately reflect the firm's financial outcomes by disclosing actual net income to both retail and sophisticated investors. The current practice of bias in the company risks legal scrutiny and long-term damage, ultimately harming small retail investors more than others due to information asymmetry. Transparency fosters trust and reliability and is crucial for strong investor confidence.", "e6": "I would have a follow-up question addressing both transparency of investor and trader treatment, ensuring equal trading exposure while also raising concerns about regulatory compliance and long-term company reputation. To the manager in charge of marketing and IR, I would ask if there is any strategy that involves educating small investors on unbiased reporting or communicating the company's intentions to move toward transparency. Additionally, it would be important to discuss possible solutions for mitigating unfair advantages larger capital players might seize.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 5, "g": 2, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
