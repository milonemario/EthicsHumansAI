However, maintaining transparency and avoiding potential legal risks should be a top priority. To address these issues, the board could implement a phased transition, first communicating openly about the change in reporting policy and addressing investors' concerns, and gradually adjusting the bias over time. This would help maintain investor confidence while ensuring fairer earnings reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy ensures transparency, accountability, and integrity in financial reporting. An essential characteristic is providing investors with accurate, reliable information that reflects the company's true performance. The current bias might be considered acceptable by some, but it could expose the firm to significant risks such as legal disputes or scrutiny from regulatory bodies. A new, unbiased policy would be more ethical and promote greater trust among stakeholders, regardless of their sophistication or access to information.", "e6": "Given the CFO's concerns about maintaining high stock prices, market volatility, and potential disadvantage for retail investors, it would be valuable to further explore and clarify these points: Are there alternative methods to communicate this change in policy more effectively, to avoid investor confusion or misinterpretation? What measures can be implemented to ensure that all investors are treated fairly and transparently during the transition from a biased to unbiased reporting policy? The CFO's comments about sophisticated hedge funds exploiting the potential disadvantage for retail investors warrant further examination. It is essential to explore ways to level the playing field and mitigate this risk.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "E", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumi Haleakala", "q10": "D"}
