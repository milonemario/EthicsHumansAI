Their investing decisions and portfolio performance could suffer as a result of not being able to adjust their expectations for earnings. While the new policy aims to provide accurate financial information, I believe the potential risks to retail investors outweigh any benefits.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, honest, and consistent. It should provide clear and accurate information that helps investors make informed decisions. A policy should also minimize harm to any group of stakeholders, particularly those who may be most vulnerable, such as retail investors. In this context, transparency and a clear understanding of the adjustments being made are crucial. For instance, if a company chooses not to adjust its reported earnings, it should clearly communicate this decision and provide evidence or justifications for why this choice was made.", "e6": "What plans are in place to ensure that retail investors can adjust their expectations for earnings under the new policy, and how will this be communicated to them?
