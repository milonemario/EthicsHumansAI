While acknowledging the CFO's concerns about potential market reactions and investor confusion, the risk of legal liability and an investigation by the SEC should be weighed against these factors. The board should consider implementing strategies to educate investors about the change in policy and address any potential disadvantages for retail investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize accuracy and transparency, minimize bias, and protect investors from misinformation. In this case, the current practice of over-reporting earnings by 50 cents can be seen as questionable due to its potential negative impact on long-term investor trust and relationships. The board should weigh the potential risks associated with legal liability or SEC investigation, market reactions, and the protection of retail investors against the benefits of a more transparent policy. Ethics dictate that the board prioritize an unbiased reporting process in order to protect shareholders and maintain long-term sustainability.", "e6": "As a board member, I would ask several follow-up questions to clarify the situation further. First, I would consider requesting additional analysis on the risks and benefits of changing to an unbiased reporting policy in terms of potential legal liability, retaliation from investors, and impact on retail investors. Second, I would explore alternative methods for communicating the change in reporting policy to investors to ensure a fair and level playing field. Finally, I would request the CFO to provide examples of any past instances where investors were misled or the firm faced legal consequences as a result of its current reporting practice.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
