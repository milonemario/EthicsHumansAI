However, effective communication and investor education are crucial to mitigate potential market reactions and protect retail investors from exploitation. Additionally, continued review of the implications on small investors should be conducted to avoid any unintended negative consequences.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should strive for transparency, accuracy, and consistency in reporting financial information to all stakeholders, including investors. The consideration of fairness to investors is crucial. Avoiding biased EPS or any other bias is essential as it contributes to informed decision-making and investor protection. Furthermore, a no-bias policy helps build trust with the investing public and mitigates potential legal risks. Prioritizing the interests of sophisticated investors over smaller retail investors should not be tolerated in pursuit of short-term gains or maintaining perceived stock strength.", "e6": "In this complex scenario, I would have the following questions for the management team: 1. Can you provide evidence of investor confusion or misinterpretation due to biased EPS reporting? 2. Are legal liabilities greater under current policy and how does that change with a transparent, bias-free policy? 3. What specific measures can be implemented to mitigate potential consequences for retail investors in the transition to a new, unbiased financial reporting policy, while ensuring fairness to all market participants? 4. Can market expectations of earnings performance be managed more effectively with the implementation of the new policy and if so, how?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "The question posed pertains to financial reporting choices at ABC company and potential ethical decisions for the board of directors.
