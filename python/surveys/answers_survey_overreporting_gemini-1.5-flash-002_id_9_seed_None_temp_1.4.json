Switching to the new, unbiased policy aligns the company with higher ethical standards, building long-term trust with investors.  The potential temporary negative market reaction is a calculated risk worth taking for the sake of integrity and transparency.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It fairly represents the company's financial performance without manipulation or intentional misdirection.  It considers the needs of all stakeholders, not just short-term stock price, and ensures consistent application of accounting standards.  Furthermore, it proactively communicates any changes to policy and their implications, promoting understanding and avoiding potential misinterpretations.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the policy change and mitigate potential negative market reactions.  I'd also want to understand their analysis of the risks and potential rewards associated with the transition, including a detailed assessment of the likely impact on different investor groups (retail vs. institutional). Finally, I would want a timeline for implementation, with clear milestones and accountability measures.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 3, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
