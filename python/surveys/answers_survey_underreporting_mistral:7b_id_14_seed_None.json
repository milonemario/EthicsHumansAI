The board should implement open communication about the change in policy to alleviate any short-term market uncertainty and work towards building confidence in ABC's commitment to transparency and integrity.", "e5": "An ethical financial reporting policy should be transparent, truthful and consistent. Transparency is crucial for public trust and requires clear communications about the reporting process. Truthfulness refers to not adjusting the earnings in either direction or misleading investors with biased information. Consistency means that the practice should not change based on market conditions or specific investor groups. In this context, it would be unethical to intentionally underreport earnings as it misleads investors and introduces uncertainty. The board should prioritize open communication about any changes in policy to promote public trust and address potential concerns among various investor classes.", "e6": "I would follow up by asking for data on potential adverse impacts of under-reporting practice on smaller investors and market liquidity, and inquire about plans to address any discrepancies during the transition period when changing the reporting policy. Additionally, I would ask about specific steps planned to communicate the change to the whole investor base, ensuring that all investors understand the reasons for the policy change and are equipped to adjust their evaluations of ABC accordingly.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 4, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
