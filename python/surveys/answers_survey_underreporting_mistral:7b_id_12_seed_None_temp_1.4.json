The current policy lacks transparency by not disclosing its practice of underreporting earnings, raising questions about potential dishonesty or bias. Additionally, the inconsiderate effect on retail investors when changing to an unbiased reporting is a concern, as they need equal knowledge and opportunity for financial prosperity. Lastly, the board should avoid short-term gains (market rewards) at a detriment to its reputation and long-term relationships with all investors if that comes from maintaining a biased or misleading policy.", "e6": "I would question: Could a phased implementation of a less biased reporting policy potentially help mitigate unintentional disadvantaging of retail investors?
