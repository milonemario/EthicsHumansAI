While acknowledging concerns about short-term market volatility, it is also important to consider the integrity of the firm, investor trust, transparency, and adherence to legal requirements. A transparent and honest approach ultimately benefits all stakeholders, especially small retail investors, by minimizing insider trading advantages for aggressive hedge funds.", "e5": "A ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty and integrity above immediate financial gains. By under-reporting earnings, ABC is not only misguiding investors but also risking its long-term reputation and credibility. A no-bias reporting policy promotes fairness across all investors, avoiding potential market manipulations and unfair advantages by sophisticated hedge funds against small retail investors. While change might lead to immediate resistance or short-term losses, it will enable trust and stability in the long-term.", "e6": "It's important to explore potential long-term consequences of both policies.
