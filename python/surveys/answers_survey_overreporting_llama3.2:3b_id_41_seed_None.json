The CFO's concerns about making investor relations more difficult and potentially harming retail investors who are not attuned to adjusting for the bias are valid. While I understand the desire to be transparent and fair in reporting earnings, the practical considerations suggest that a more nuanced approach may be necessary to balance competing interests and avoid unintended harm.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should accurately reflect the company's financial performance without intentionally deceiving or misleading stakeholders. The policy should also consider the diverse needs of its investors, including retail and sophisticated investors, and strive to minimize harm to any group.
