Changing policies without a clear plan to address these concerns risks negatively impacting the company's stock price and jeopardizing the interests of smaller shareholders. A phased approach, perhaps with transparent communication about the change and its implications, would be necessary to mitigate these risks before implementing the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy.  It should clearly and consistently communicate the methodology used, avoiding any ambiguity or practices that could mislead investors, particularly smaller ones.  Materiality, the potential impact of the reported information on investment decisions, should also be a key factor, prompting full and fair disclosure of any relevant circumstances or adjustments.  Finally, the policy should consider the potential impact of the reporting on different investor segments, aiming for equitable treatment and avoiding practices that could provide an unfair advantage to some over others.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to better understand the potential market reaction to the change.  This includes: 1) What specific strategies are being considered to mitigate the risk of a negative investor response? 2) How will the change be communicated to different investor groups, including retail investors, to ensure understanding and minimize confusion? 3) What is the projected timeline for implementing the new policy, and what are the potential hurdles and contingencies that might affect this timetable?  These questions will help assess the feasibility and risks of the change.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
