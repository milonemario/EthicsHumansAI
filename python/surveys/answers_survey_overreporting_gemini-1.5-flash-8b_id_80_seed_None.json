Maintaining a transparent earnings reporting system, even if it initially results in perceived underperformance, is ultimately more beneficial for the company's reputation and sustained success. The short-term reputational hit is a risk worth taking to maintain honesty and avoid future, more substantial problems related to deception.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids intentional manipulation of financial data, even if seemingly justified by short-term market pressures.  Full disclosure of material information, a clear explanation of accounting methods, and consistency over time are key.  Consideration must be given to the potential impact on all stakeholders, not just investors, and whether the policy promotes long-term sustainable success.  A policy should never mislead or deceive, even if the intent is to prevent short-term negative consequences.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask for a detailed breakdown of the potential market impact (both positive and negative) of the new policy, including projected investor reactions, and how the company plans to communicate the change to investors and retail shareholders to mitigate any negative perception. Also, I'd want to know what contingency plans are in place to address potential investor criticism and how to manage situations in which investors misunderstand the change in policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
