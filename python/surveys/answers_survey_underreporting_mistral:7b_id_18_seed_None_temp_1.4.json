The continuous adherence to the current method raises legitimate concerns, particularly regarding possible legal exposure due to a seemingly intentional financial misrepresentation. With today's highly transparant and connected economic marketplace, upgrading our financial practices can help us maintain an attractive investment profile based on trustworthiness and credibility, ensuring continued good standing with industry regulators (such as the Securities and Exchange Commission). Although it will cause a short-term market disruption among all investor groups, long-term benefits and equity fairness in trading will provide better advantages for individual shareholders such as retail investors. Lastly, focusing on the larger context of investing rather than prioritizing the preferences of certain insiders or institutions may eventually lead to further stability and growth opportunities for ABC over the long run.", "e5": "In order for a reporting policy to be considered ethical, several factors must be balanced; including accuracy, clarity, transparency, consistency, compliance, and fair disclosure. The context shared in the vignette indicates that both internal and external entities believe that it is acceptable to under-report earnings by 50 cents if earnings are subsequently compensated accordingly. However, considering legal concerns about bias and ethical guidelines regarding misrepresentation, I suggest a reporting policy for ABC that adheres to the 'spirit of truthfulness' rather than indulging in accounting manipulations due to short-term considerations. The characteristics highlighted above indicate my position that ABC should strive toward being fully compliant with financial regulations while fairly disclosing information in order to protect both retail and institutional investors alike, ensuring that any positive or negative adjustments for earnings take place during legitimate periods of corporate performance or volatility.", "e6": "Yes , I would ask for further clarification to ensure that ABC 's management fully understands the implications of continued under-reporting of EPS. More specifically, here are a few follow-up questions to be explored :(1) What are all short term and long term repercussions with either financial reporting policies?(2)Are there any other alternative strategies other than underestimating/biasing the earnings ?(3)What is management willing to do to create necessary transparency when dealing with the retail investor class? And lastly,(4)If there are instances where certain sophisticated investors can exploit bias in our reported EPS, are additional actions needed within investor relations or communication strategies?.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "B", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
