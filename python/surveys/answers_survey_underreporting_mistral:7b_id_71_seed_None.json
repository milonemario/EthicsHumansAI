While the current practice hasn't resulted in any evident misinformation, it exposes the firm to potential legal liability and scrutiny from regulatory bodies. Additionally, continuing this practice risks harming retail investors as sophisticated hedge funds could take advantage of the discrepancy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should aim for transparency, honesty, and integrity. In ABC's context, a policy biasing EPS downward presents potential risks such as legal liability and lack of investor protection, which could undermine the trust and reputation of the company in the long term. A no-bias reporting policy would more accurately reflect the firm's financial performance, enhance its credibility and reduce the possibility of market manipulation or exploitation by sophisticated investors like hedge funds at the expense of retail investors.", "e6": "As a member of ABC's board, I have some questions regarding the long-term implications and ethical considerations of maintaining the current bias in EPS reporting. Firstly, what are the potential consequences if our reported earnings do not meet investor expectations adjusted for bias in the future? This includes the possibility of market volatility, damage to our reputation, or attracting litigation. Secondly, what steps would be taken to address and educate retail investors about this change to a no-bias reporting policy, ensuring they are neither misled nor disadvantaged vis-a-vis sophisticated traders? Lastly, considering the increasing importance placed on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in investment decisions, how will our continued bias practices affect ABC's ESG rating and, by extension, attract investors who prioritize ethically sound companies?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua, a rock-like body from the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars detected in October 2017 by the Pan-STARRS observatory in Hawaii.", "q10": "D"}
