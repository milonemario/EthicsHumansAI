Changing to a new, honest policy is crucial for maintaining investor trust and compliance with securities laws. Communicating this change may be challenging, but it can be overcome by an effective public relations campaign emphasizing transparency, integrity, and long-term business sustainability.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should uphold transparency and accuracy, promote integrity, comply with legal requirements, and ensure that investors are offered a fair chance to make informed decisions. In the given scenario, reporting bias in earnings might expose the firm to potential legal liability or investor distrust. A policy without bias would be more honest and reduce the chances of investor confusion or exploitation. The difficulty of communicating such change needs careful handling, with strategies tailored for different investor groups without unfairly disadvantaging any class. Investment decisions should not depend on manipulated information for a competitive edge.", "e6": "As a board member, I would ask the management team to elaborate on potential solutions for credibly communicating the change in reporting policy while preserving investor trust. Additionally, I would seek clarification on how the legal department plans to address the possible risks of litigation or SEC investigation related to overreported earnings. Lastly, given the CFO's concern about impacting retail investors, I would request an analysis of the potential risks and benefits for each class of investor under different reporting policies.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 4, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "A", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "B", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
