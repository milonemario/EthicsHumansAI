Maintaining the current policy, despite its less-than-ideal ethical standing, appears to be the less risky option given the financial implications for the company and its stakeholders.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors, even unintentionally, and strives for a clear, understandable presentation that fairly reflects the company's financial performance.  Stakeholder interests, including both investors and the public, must be considered.  The policy should be consistent over time, avoiding manipulation, and if changes are necessary, these changes should be well-communicated and justified.  Finally, the policy must uphold relevant regulations and standards of accounting practice.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to understand the precise market reaction models used to predict the negative impact of the policy change on stock price.  Also, I'd need more detail about the specific strategies the Investor Relations team plans to use to communicate the policy change to mitigate potential investor confusion, and their ability to distinguish between sophisticated and retail investors. Finally, what safeguards or mitigating measures are being implemented to ensure that any potential advantage sophisticated investors might gain is minimized?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
