Although a temporary negative market reaction is possible, the transition to transparent reporting is ultimately more beneficial.

It presents a complete and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any manipulation or selective disclosure of information.  It also considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, not just shareholders, and adheres to all relevant accounting standards and regulations.  The policy's implementation should be consistently applied and clearly communicated.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to detail their plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors, specifically addressing how they will mitigate potential misunderstandings and prevent sophisticated investors from exploiting the transition.
