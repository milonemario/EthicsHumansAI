However, a measured step toward increased disclosure may help the stock perform better with less bias in investor perception.  This can be achieved using an 'Honest Reporting Policy' so as to build public trust over time. A gradual shift towards more transparent earnings would lead to less financial vulnerability and greater public perception of fairness, resulting in consistent and sustainable growth.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy in business is one that balances transparency, integrity, and stakeholder interests.
