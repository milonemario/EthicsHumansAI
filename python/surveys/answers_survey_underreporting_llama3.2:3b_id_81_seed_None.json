While eliminating biases in reported earnings is a positive move, concerns about investor reaction and potential impact on retail investors raise questions about the policy's wisdom. The CFO's comments about investors still adjusting the EPS upward by 50 cents even under an unbiased policy suggest that this may be more of an adjustment than a complete elimination of misperception. A more gradual transition with careful management of expectations may be advisable.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, honest, and responsive to the needs of all stakeholders. It should provide a clear picture of the company's financial performance without omitting or misrepresenting information that could influence investor decisions. The policy should also be free from biases or manipulations that could deceive investors or distort market prices. Additionally, it should demonstrate a commitment to accountability, with procedures in place to ensure compliance and mitigate potential negative consequences of incorrect reporting. Transparency and accuracy are essential for maintaining trust and credibility.", "e6": "Yes, I would have a follow-up question to seek further clarification on the potential impact of the new policy on retail investors who may not be aware of the adjusted EPS. Specifically, I would ask the CFO if the company plans to provide any additional support or communication to help these investors understand the changes and how they may affect their investment decisions.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "2013 A1", "q10": "B"}
