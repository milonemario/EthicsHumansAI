The new policy, despite temporary market volatility, promotes honesty, avoids legal repercussions, and ensures a level playing field for all investors. As such, it is advisable to recommend adherence to the new policy, accompanied by clear and transparent communication strategies.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize honesty, accuracy, transparency, and fairness. It is crucial to disclose all relevant financial information accurately, without any intentional bias or deception. A policy that consistently underreports earnings not only violates these principles but also exposes the company to legal risks and investor distrust. In this context, it is important to consider the effects on both retail and institutional investors, ensuring a level playing field and preventing sophisticated funds from exploiting less experienced investors.", "e6": "It is crucial to question the rationale behind maintaining a biased reporting policy, despite its obvious ethical concerns. As a board member, asking the following questions could help clarify the situation and facilitate an informed decision: 1.) What steps has the management team taken to educate retail investors on the new no-bias policy, ensuring they understand the change in reporting practice? 2.) How can the management team guarantee that sophisticated investors will not exploit the short-term volatility caused by the shift to unbiased earnings reporting? 3.) Are there possible strategies for implementing the new policy, minimizing harm to retail investors while ensuring fairness and integrity in financial reporting?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "C", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
