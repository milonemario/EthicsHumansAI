Ultimately, it should reflect the company's commitment to truthful and reliable financial reporting, fostering trust with all stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about the specific mechanisms used to bias the current reporting, the projected impact of the change on various investor segments (including retail investors and sophisticated funds), and the potential strategies for managing any negative market reactions to the change in policy in the short term, in addition to a risk assessment of the potential long-term investor relationship damage from continuing the current policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
