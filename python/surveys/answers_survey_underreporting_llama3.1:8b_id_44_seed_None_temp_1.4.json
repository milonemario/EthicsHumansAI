Retail investors rely on reported earnings directly without adjusting for expected future performance adjustments.", "e5": "In a financial reporting context, I would deem an ethical policy to be one that prioritizes transparency and truthfulness. This means reporting real, objective numbers that are untainted by bias or intentional manipulation. The interests of all stakeholders should be considered, including investors, but also the company's integrity and its relationship with the public. Considerations such as investor sophistication, market volatility, and the potential impact on retail versus institutional investors like hedge funds might influence policy-making, but would not take precedence over fundamental ethical principles. An ethical standard in reporting would promote trust in financial markets.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask several questions to the management team. For instance, what specific actions will be taken to educate and inform retail investors about the change to the new policy with unbiased earnings reporting?
