To mitigate this risk, the board could consider implementing a disclosure policy that explicitly flags any adjustments to earnings or implements a system to manage expectations and prevent market manipulation.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical when it prioritizes transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should clearly disclose any adjustments or biases in earnings calculations, provide contextual information to help investors make informed decisions, and avoid manipulating market expectations.
