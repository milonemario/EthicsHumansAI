Due to legal counsel's guidance and the SEC investigation risk, it's advisable the board changes policies and reports earnings neutrally, providing the opportunity for ABC to improve its reputation. The need to adjust upward by 50 cents will likely continue among investors regardless of a policy change, ensuring long-term investor trust.", "e5": "`For a reporting policy to be viewed as ethical, it should maintain credibility among investors by prioritizing transparent, unbiased financial reporting. Such a reporting policy fosters trust and promotes accountability across the company. Ethical disclosures ensure long-term investor protection from adverse effects of any short-term gains, uphold industry standards in a competitive market, avoid legal liability, reduce chances of regulatory scrutiny and contribute to the overall prosperity of the firm in the best interests of every stakeholder, including retail investors. The board, however, must address challenges in communicating any policy change and strive for methods to safeguard all investors' equity position in this endeavor.`", "e6": "To help ensure ethical transparency in ABC's financial reporting, I would ask: If retail investors have been adversely affected by the earnings bias, how can management minimize any harm to these shareholders during a transition to the revised policy? Are there steps the management team can take alongside any earnings adjustments so the transition doesn't disadvantage under-informed investors? Would a proactive communications strategy be warranted in educating all investors about the company\u2019s new reporting policies? If changing the current bias would provide future opportunities for enhanced performance, how does the board plan to address and allay investor fears and justify the proposed policy change despite negative earnings surprises in the short term?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua, a hyperactive comet or interstellar asteroid was the first to be detected passing through our solar system in October 2017.", "q10": "D"}
