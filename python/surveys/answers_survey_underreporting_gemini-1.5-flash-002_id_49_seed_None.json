Switching to the new policy, while potentially causing short-term market volatility, establishes long-term credibility and ethical integrity, fostering trust with all stakeholders.  The potential for short-term losses is outweighed by the long-term benefits of honest reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, unbiased, and consistently applied.  It should provide a fair and accurate representation of the company's financial performance without misleading investors, regardless of their level of sophistication.  Consideration should be given to potential impacts on different investor groups, but deliberate manipulation to favor certain groups is unethical.  Complete and timely disclosure of any changes in accounting policies is crucial.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market reaction to the policy change, including a detailed plan to communicate the change effectively to investors. I would also want to understand their strategy for mitigating any negative consequences and fostering investor confidence in the long term.
