It should accurately reflect a company's financial position, without manipulation or bias. The policy should prioritize clear and timely disclosure of relevant information to allow informed decision-making by all stakeholders, including investors and analysts. In the context of this scenario, the use of historical reporting inconsistencies as a reference point may suggest a desire for stability and consistency, but such practices can perpetuate misunderstandings and miscommunication, ultimately hindering rather than aiding transparency.", "e6": "Yes.
