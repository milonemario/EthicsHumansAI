Therefore, it is advisable to change the current EPS reporting practices to avoid further risk.", "e5": "To ensure a reporting policy at ABC is ethical, it must promote transparency and comply with regulations such as reporting financial accounts honestly, comprehensibly and accurately. By adopting unbiased principles for representing earnings per share without concealing relevant information or artificially boosting the reported figures, an unhindered investment decision can be made by retail and sophisticated institutional investors alike with confidence in the performance of the company. Prioritizing public interest and integrity over convenience or temporary benefits to executives is critical. To mitigate inequality concerns between retail versus sophisticated investors, it may also necessitate clear, consistent communication regarding significant changes like a switch to unbiased reporting policy.", "e6": "As a current board member, further questions to discuss with management would be concerning potential short- and long-term consequences of both policies. For example, clarifying the CFO's strategy for implementing a no bias reporting policy while avoiding confusion among investors, managing increased regulatory scrutiny, and reducing perceived negative impacts on the retail investors by adopting clear open communication regarding the decision-making process, the rationale behind it, the transition details, potential impact on earnings and growth and ensuring that all stakeholders, especially smaller investors will benefit.
