Ultimately, long-term integrity should outweigh those concerns.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be ethical when it provides accurate, unbiased and transparent financial information that reflects the actual performance of the company. It should maintain trust among stakeholders and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The board should weigh the potential market reaction to a change in policy against the long-term benefits of honest and fair financial reporting.

Firstly, are there any potential long-term negative consequences for maintaining the current policy and continuing to overstate earnings? Secondly, what measures have been taken to ensure that retail investors are protected and not disadvantaged compared to sophisticated hedge funds in this situation? Lastly, have legal opinions been sought from multiple sources or firms to confirm the current practice's potential risks and liabilities?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "A", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "D", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
