It should also provide investors with accurate information to make informed decisions.

Additionally, transparency about changes in policies can help build trust among investors, whereas ongoing practices like ABC's might foster skepticism and diminish credibility.", "e6": "Yes, I would have some follow-up questions for the management team.
