There is also a chance that some investors might exploit this disparity for short term gains during market volatility, leading to unexpected financial fallout. Therefore, while ethically sound, it's recommended to proceed cautiously and prioritize transparency for long-term sustainability.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is one that prioritizes truthful and transparent information for all stakeholders. It includes consistency with accounting standards, disclosure of material risks or opportunities, and clear communication between management and investors to allow for informed decision-making.  Ethical policies are fair and avoid exploiting investor reliance on market trends, especially around biases, without jeopardizing the long-term stability of the business.", "e6": "Yes. I'd like to clarify a few points before proceeding with changes:  \n* **Legal Counsel**: Have you consulted legal counsel on transitioning to this new policy, considering SEC regulations and the potential vulnerability of this approach? \n* **Investor Communications**: How exactly would we communicate the shift in reporting policy?
