This approach fosters trust by demonstrating a commitment to open communication and the responsibility of accurately representing their company's performance.  A true reflection of the company\u2019s financial health will help build long-term sustainable relationships.", "e6": "While this situation appears concerning, with a change in policy and increased market transparency, having a long-term plan for dealing with these concerns seems crucial.
