As a board member, my concern is that the market reaction could be negative in the short term, potentially harming retail investors who lack sophisticated investment strategies. Therefore, I would recommend proceeding with caution and exploring ways to mitigate these effects while still adopting the new policy.", "e5": "A reporting policy can be considered ethical if it prioritizes transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should clearly communicate the information being reported and avoid any manipulation or deception that could lead investors to make uninformed decisions. The policy should also consider the impact on all stakeholders, particularly retail investors who may lack the sophistication to adjust for biases. Additionally, the policy should be free from conflicts of interest and designed to promote long-term trust and stability in financial reporting. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy promotes market integrity and informed decision-making.", "e6": "Yes,", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "B", "q9": "2015 TF135", "q10": "B"}
