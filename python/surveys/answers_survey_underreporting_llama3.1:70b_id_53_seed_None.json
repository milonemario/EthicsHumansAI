Sophisticated investors who understand the change will trade at an advantage against retail investors who may not be aware of the policy shift. This could lead to unnecessary market volatility and potential losses for some investor groups. Additionally, the current policy has been in place for a while, and most investors have adjusted their expectations accordingly. Therefore, maintaining the status quo seems like the most prudent decision, despite its minor imperfections.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should also consider the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders, including different types of investors, regulators, and external auditors. In the context of financial reporting, transparency means providing clear and concise information that allows users to make informed decisions. The policy should also be consistent with relevant laws and regulations, as well as generally accepted accounting principles. Consideration of power imbalances between large and small investors is also crucial, ensuring that no particular group is unfairly disadvantaged by the reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions. What specific steps would management take to educate retail investors about the policy change and mitigate potential disadvantages for this group?
