While a sudden switch to a policy without bias could potentially lead to a short-term market downturn, the long-term benefits of honesty, corporate responsibility and integrity surpass these risks. Consequently, I strongly recommend embracing the new no-bias financial reporting policy, improving shareholder confidence, enhancing financial credibility and promoting responsible retail participation.", "e5": "In ethical financial reporting policies, transparency and integrity play significant roles. Regarding current practice at ABC, while there's evidence that investors have adjusted for the reported EPS bias, there is still an inherent unfairness since some investors could gain information advantage over others, causing potential exploitation. Furthermore, hiding such deception from legal authorities can bring a firm under potential scrutiny and damage their social reputation. Therefore, to develop ethical reporting policies, a board ought to prioritize financial responsibility, ensure that all stakeholders have fair access to accurate and unbiased reports, maintain regulatory compliance, avoid any misinformed expectations, prevent undue gains, and instill long-term sustainability for its investors.", "e6": "Indeed, to better evaluate the situation and make a well-rounded decision it might be beneficial to further clarify a few points:. Clarify management's intentions for not changing the policy despite investors being knowledgeable of underreporting practices (are there hidden agendas or interests at stake?); provide evidence on how current underrepresented earnings per share could potentially expose the company to legal action from regulatory officials, as mentioned by the counsel; gather investor perspectives on their awareness and preparedness for a decrease in performance due to reporting unbiased returns; seek recommendations given market reaction that may lead to short-term rewards followed by possible future downturns caused by biased adjustments of earnings figures. All in all having an open discussion will support making a solid decision with all perspectives involved, and thus contributing to sound business principles at the company and long lasting trust among the investor community.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 3, "f": 4, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "C", "q9": "CFO expressed reluctance towards changing to new unbiased earnings reporting that might result in disadvantage towards retail investors over sophisticated hedge funds who are 'attentive to [this kind of] stuff'", "q10": "C"}
