Although some investors, particularly retail ones, may be initially hurt by the change, it is better to adopt a policy that accurately reflects the company's true earnings. The current policy's intentional bias could lead to potential risks of regulatory scrutiny or reputational damage if discovered. Adopting the new policy can help mitigate these risks and promote long-term credibility with investors.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial position without intentionally introducing errors or omissions. Additionally, the policy should be applied consistently to ensure comparability across periods. Considerations pertinent to this context include avoiding practices that might mislead investors, maintaining regulatory compliance, and promoting fairness among all classes of investors. Furthermore, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize the needs of less sophisticated stakeholders, such as retail investors, who may require moreProtection and clear guidance.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions. What are the expected short-term and long-term impacts of adopting the new policy on our stock price and investor sentiment? How do you plan to communicate this change to our retail investors and other stakeholders who may be affected by it? Are there any potential regulatory issues or risks that we should be aware of when transitioning to the new policy? What is the plan for ensuring a smooth transition and minimizing disruption to our financial reporting processes?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "'Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
