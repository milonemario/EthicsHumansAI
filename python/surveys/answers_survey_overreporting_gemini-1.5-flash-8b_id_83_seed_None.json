While the new policy may initially face market skepticism, the long-term benefits of ethical financial reporting and transparency \u2013 building trust with investors \u2013 outweigh potential short-term issues.  The company's reputation and long-term value are prioritized over immediate stock price concerns.", "e5": "Ethical reporting policies prioritize transparency and accuracy.  They must avoid intentional manipulation or deception, even if perceived as beneficial in the short term.  Full disclosure of material information, consistent application of accounting principles, and avoidance of bias are essential components.  Furthermore, the policy should consider the impact on all stakeholders, not just the immediate financial gains for management or investors.", "e6": "Yes.  I would want to understand the predicted impact of the new policy on stock price, particularly in the short term, and what mitigation strategies are in place for investor reactions. I would also ask about the specific reasons for the 50-cent bias in the current policy and whether these reasons still hold validity. Finally, I need to know how the company will assure that any adjustments to the reporting process are handled objectively and not for short-term gains.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
