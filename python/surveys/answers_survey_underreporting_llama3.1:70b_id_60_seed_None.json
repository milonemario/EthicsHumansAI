Additionally, sophisticated hedge funds may trade at an advantage against small investors who do not adjust quickly to the new policy. These potential negative outcomes outweigh the benefits of reporting unbiased earnings. The current policy, although biased, is well-understood by investors and does not mislead them. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain the status quo and avoid unnecessary disruptions.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it exhibits transparency, consistency, and fairness. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information to stakeholders, be consistently applied over time, and avoid misleading or deceiving investors. Additionally, considerations such as the potential impact on vulnerable groups, like retail investors, and the avoidance of inadvertently creating unequal access to information are important. In the context of financial reporting, ethical policies also prioritize accuracy and reliability, ensuring that investors can make informed decisions based on trustworthy data.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask follow-up questions to gain a deeper understanding of the potential implications of changing to the new policy. Specifically, I would like to know: What measures can be taken to mitigate the potential negative impacts on retail investors? How would the company ensure that all stakeholders are adequately informed about the change in reporting policy? Are there any regulatory or industry-wide standards that could provide guidance on this matter?
