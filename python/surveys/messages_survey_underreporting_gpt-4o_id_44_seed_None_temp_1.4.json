The company has enjoyed stable growth over the years and is considered a safe investment due to its consistent performance.\nAs a board member of ABC, you are required to review the following question about the firm\u2019s financial reporting. The stock has been trading at $100 per share and its reported earnings per share this year were $10. Under the current policy, the firm has established a practice of consistently under-reporting its earnings per share (EPS) by 50 cents.\nThis practice has been consistent and well-understood by the investor community, who, in various interviews, have recognized that earnings must be adjusted upward by this amount. However, legal counsel has warned that, while there is no evidence that investors are being misled, the earnings are biased and could expose the firm to legal liability or an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The board is considering changing to a new policy in which earnings are without bias."}, {"role": "system", "content": "In an interview with the board, the CFO shared concerns about the practice, which was initiated by prior management, noting:\n\"I would personally prefer that reported earnings be without bias as it would make my life easier. However, we\u2019ll be raising new equity for the next few years and investors know full well that we wish to avoid negative earnings surprises in the future. If we change the current policy to the new policy without bias, there will be no way for my investor relations team to credibly communicate the change in policy. The market would reward us in the short term and later punish us for lower performance, because most investors would still adjust our reported earnings upward by 50 cents.\"\nHe paused and added:\n\"I\u2019m also worried that our retail investors would be hurt. Some sophisticated hedge funds are more attentive to this sort of thing and would understand that new no-bias policy. They would trade at an advantage against small investors.
