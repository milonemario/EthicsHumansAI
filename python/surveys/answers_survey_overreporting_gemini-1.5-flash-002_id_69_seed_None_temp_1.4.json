Building trust with investors in the long run is more valuable than maintaining artificially inflated short-term stock prices through deceptive practices.  The potential for informed trading among sophisticated investors is a market reality, not a sufficient justification for maintaining unethical behavior.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents information fairly, without manipulation or intentional bias.

It should also comply with all applicable laws and regulations and be consistently applied over time.  A commitment to correcting errors promptly and openly is crucial.", "e6": "I would ask about a detailed communication plan to accompany the policy change, aimed at educating investors about the shift to unbiased reporting.
