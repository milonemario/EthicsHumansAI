A move to the new policy, though potentially facing initial market adjustments, is ultimately more ethical and fosters long-term investor confidence by promoting honest and accurate financial reporting.  The potential for short-term market reactions is outweighed by the benefits of improved credibility and investor trust in the long run.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy.  It should clearly communicate all relevant financial information without manipulation or undisclosed biases.  Materiality, context, and investor sophistication are also key; highly complex or specialized industries might require additional disclosure, while sophisticated investors may understand adjustments better than retail ones.  Ultimately, the policy must foster trust and confidence in the company's financial statements, not just avoid short-term market reactions.", "e6": "Yes, I'd want to understand the specific details of the current earnings manipulation, including the methodology used and the rationale behind it.  I'd also ask about the projected impact of the policy change on future earnings forecasts, particularly how the shift from biased to unbiased reporting might affect investor expectations and potentially lead to a short-term reaction in the market.  Finally, I'd want to discuss a communication strategy to address potential concerns from investors and explain the shift to a more transparent policy in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
