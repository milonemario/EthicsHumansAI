A phased transition period, where earnings are reported with transparency for investors to adjust and potentially anticipate price fluctuations, would be ideal for ABC's stability.  This transparency fosters trust with investors and avoids the potentially disruptive effects of a sudden change in reporting practices.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy for a publicly traded company, like ABC, should prioritize full transparency and honesty.  While some adjustments might be justified, these shouldn't mislead investors and their understanding of the company's true financial health. This means aligning earnings reports with actual business performance while acknowledging its short-term variability, ensuring accurate market perceptions and contributing to long-term investor trust.", "e6": "Yes, I do have some follow-up questions for the ABC management team: \n \t 1.  What is the company's precise plan to implement this transitional phase? What specific dates or timeline will be established for each stage of transition regarding reporting practices?\n \t 2. How do we anticipate engaging with key investor groups during this process, especially those who may have concerns about the change?
