Although some investors may initially misinterpret the change, it's essential for the company to provide unbiased information. The potential short-term impact on stock price is outweighed by the long-term benefits of increased credibility and trust with investors. Moreover, not making the change could expose the company to regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. This means providing timely and unbiased information to all stakeholders, without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. The policy should also be consistent and reliable, allowing investors to make informed decisions. Additionally, considerations such as regulatory compliance, corporate social responsibility, and protection of vulnerable stakeholders (e.g., retail investors) should be taken into account. In the context of financial reporting, it's essential to strike a balance between providing detailed information and avoiding unnecessary complexity that could confuse or mislead stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask follow-up questions to clarify how management plans to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors, particularly retail investors who may be less sophisticated and more likely to misinterpret the new policy. I would also like to know what steps the company will take to educate investors about the changes and provide support during the transition period. Additionally, I would ask whether management has considered any contingency plans in case of an adverse reaction from investors or a significant impact on the stock price.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "'Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
