By continuing such practices for short-term investor interests, the board sacrifices the long-term stability of the company, its legal compliance, and equity fairness. Further, large institutions maintaining their superior edge over retail investors exacerbates wealth inequality.", "e5": "For ethical reporting, policies should focus on transparency, accountability, credibility, honesty, impartiality, integrity, and consistency. The practice of oversharing earnings can expose firms to legal liability due to biases and unfair trading advantages withheld from retail investors. Furthermore, disclosure-oriented policies contribute to financial trust, enhance regulatory compliance, reduce information misinterpretations, maintain fairness in competition amongst firms, and promote equity for all stakeholders regardless of investor sophistication.", "e6": "The current inconsistency between reported and actual earnings creates a risk of legal liability, misleading investors, and wealth inequality. To avoid these issues, I would direct my follow-up questions at the CFO regarding their rationale for maintaining the policy. Question 1: In what ways do retail investors benefit from overstated EPS in long-term? Question 2: When considering investor relations, could alternative communication strategies be employed to build credibility and convey the new no-bias reporting policy to our stakeholders? Lastly, with legal counsel's concerns about potential investigations due to earnings bias, I would ask about the firm\u2019s internal compliance procedures and whether they could be utilized, optimized, or revised to support the transition to unbiased EPS reporting.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 1, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 4, "g": 4, "h": 5}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "The CFO appears to prioritize consistency and market perception over financial integrity.

Additionally, small individual investors could be at a disadvantage as hedge funds would understand the change in policy and exploit inconsistencies.
