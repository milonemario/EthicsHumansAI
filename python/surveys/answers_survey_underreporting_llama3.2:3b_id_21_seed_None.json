Changing to the new policy could harm retail investors, particularly those with less expertise or resources, who may react negatively to lower-than-expected earnings. Additionally, sophisticated investors may still adjust their expectations accordingly, potentially undermining the new policy's intent. As a board member, my primary concern is ensuring that all stakeholders are treated fairly and with transparency, which suggests maintaining the current policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should provide clear disclosure of any adjustments or biases that may impact financial results, allowing investors to make informed decisions. The policy should also consider the potential consequences for various stakeholder groups, including retail investors who may be more vulnerable to price volatility. Additionally, an ethically sound policy would ensure that management is held accountable for ensuring the accuracy and integrity of financial reporting, and that policies are periodically reviewed to maintain their effectiveness and alignment with evolving market conditions.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions regarding the potential strategies for communicating the change to investors, particularly retail investors, and how the company plans to mitigate any potential harm or negative reactions.
