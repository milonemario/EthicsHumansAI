While the new policy is more transparent, the risk of investors misinterpreting the reported earnings as significantly lower, leading to a stock price drop, outweighs the benefits of improved transparency.  The CFO's concerns about investor reaction and the impact on retail investors suggest the current policy, despite its bias, is currently better for the company's short-term financial health.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy.  It should be consistently applied, avoiding manipulation or bias, and clearly communicated to all stakeholders.  The policy should also consider the potential impact on various investor types, recognizing that sophisticated investors may react differently than retail investors.  Full disclosure of any adjustments or changes in methodology is crucial to maintain trust and avoid misleading any investor group.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed market analysis projecting the potential stock price impact of the new policy change, focusing on the reactions of both sophisticated and retail investors.  I'd also inquire about alternative communication strategies to mitigate investor misinterpretation, such as providing clear explanatory statements or supplementary disclosures about the policy shift.  Finally, I'd want to understand the specific mechanisms by which the prior management team introduced the bias in order to avoid any similar future errors.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
