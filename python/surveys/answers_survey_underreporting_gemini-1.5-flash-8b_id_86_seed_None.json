Maintaining the current policy, despite its inherent bias, ensures investor expectations are reasonably aligned with reality, minimizing the potential for negative surprises or a loss of investor trust in future earnings reports.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, presenting financial data fairly and honestly.  It avoids misleading or deceptive practices, even if short-term gains might be achieved.  Crucially, it considers the impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors, who may lack the same access to information as sophisticated investors.  Maintaining consistent disclosure practices over time, building trust, is essential.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask about the specific risks of changing to the new policy, including potential short-term market reactions and the potential negative impact on investor sentiment and trust.  Also, what specific steps are being considered to communicate the change to investors, and how are different investor groups (retail versus institutional) being considered?  Lastly, what's the long-term plan for maintaining consistent investor confidence and understanding, as new policies and circumstances inevitably arise?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
