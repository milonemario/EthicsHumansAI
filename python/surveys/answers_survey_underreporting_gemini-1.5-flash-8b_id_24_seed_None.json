While ethical, it could lead to short-term market volatility and potentially harm retail investors.  The current policy, despite its inherent deception, seems to have a stable market impact and protects the company's interests in the short term, and potentially long term.  A thorough analysis of the potential short-term and long-term market implications is needed before changing the policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deception, even if it results in potentially negative short-term market reactions.

The policy must also consider the sophistication of the investor base and the potential for unintended consequences.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed breakdown of the anticipated market reaction to the new policy, including potential short-term and long-term effects on investor confidence and share price.
