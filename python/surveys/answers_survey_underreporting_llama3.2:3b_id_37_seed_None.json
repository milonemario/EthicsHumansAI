The change to the new policy could lead to a short-term stock price increase, but may also result in negative earnings surprises and decreased trust among retail investors. Additionally, sophisticated hedge funds may trade at an advantage against smaller investors, exacerbating existing inequalities. The current policy may be imperfect, but it is transparent and based on investor anticipation, whereas the new policy could be perceived as misleading or deceptive.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and not misleading. It should also take into account the potential impact on various stakeholders, including retail investors and sophisticated hedge funds. An ethical policy would prioritize honesty and clarity over short-term gains or protecting existing interests. This means being able to explain and justify any adjustments or biases made to reported figures in a clear and timely manner. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy should serve as a foundation for trust and credibility with stakeholders and contribute to long-term sustainability rather than solely focusing on immediate market sentiment.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "109P/Swissbank-Siders", "q10": "B"}
