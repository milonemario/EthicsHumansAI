The new policy would align with industry standards and increase transparency, which could lead to long-term cost savings and improved reputation for ABC company. Additionally, the CFO's concerns about investor relations and potential market reactions can be mitigated through clear communication and educating investors on the change in policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes honesty, transparency, and accuracy. It should provide clear guidance on what is reported, why it is reported, and how it can be interpreted. In this context, the ideal policy would disclose any intentional adjustments to earnings per share or provide sufficient detail about the method used to arrive at the reported number. The policy should also avoid misleading investors by clearly communicating the intent and scope of such adjustments.
