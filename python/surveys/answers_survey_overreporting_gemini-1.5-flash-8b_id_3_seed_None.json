Maintaining a reputation for honesty, even if it means some market adjustment in the short term, is crucial for long-term investor confidence and sustainable growth.  The current policy, while seemingly beneficial in the short term for maintaining share price, creates a dishonest foundation and may breed distrust in the long run.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents a clear, unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding manipulation or deception, even if it means potential short-term market fluctuations.  This includes clear communication of accounting methodologies, consistent application of policies, and full disclosure of material information.  Investor relations and financial reporting should focus on building long-term trust rather than short-term stock price manipulation.", "e6": "Yes.
