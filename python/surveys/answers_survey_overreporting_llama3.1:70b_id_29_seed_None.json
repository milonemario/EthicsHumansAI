Although some investors may initially be misled, the company can proactively communicate the change in policy, and over time, the market will adjust. The benefits of honest financial reporting outweigh potential short-term costs. The current policy's deliberate bias could also expose the firm to regulatory scrutiny or litigation.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should present a fair representation of the company's financial situation, without intention to deceive or mislead stakeholders. Considerations include consistency with accounting standards, clear disclosure of assumptions and methodologies, and avoidance of material omissions. Additionally, the policy should be free from conflicts of interest and not prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. In the context of publicly traded companies, ethical reporting is essential for maintaining market trust and integrity.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to clarify the potential risks and opportunities associated with changing to the new policy. Specifically, I would ask: What is the expected timeline for implementing the change? How will the company communicate the change to investors and avoid potential misunderstandings?

Are there any plans to provide additional disclosures or guidance to stakeholders during the transition period?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (also known as 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
