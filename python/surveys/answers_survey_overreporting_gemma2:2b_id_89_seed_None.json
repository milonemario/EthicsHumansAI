This practice has served them well for years but comes with risks. The new policy introduces increased transparency and honesty in reporting earnings. Short-term financial performance will be less affected than the reputational risk associated with an existing dishonest policy. A new policy will also help the company build better relationships with investors going forward.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize truth-telling and transparency. It should clearly communicate actual results, avoiding misleading adjustments or interpretations that deliberately withhold full information. This allows for informed decisions by investors without resorting to obfuscation or manipulation.  Consistency is key; applying accounting standards fairly across different situations helps build trust in financial reports. Engaging with investors about policy updates and potential impact fosters open dialogue.", "e6": "I would want to clarify several aspects of this proposed transition and understand their rationale, especially in regards to investor relations. I would ask for a concrete action plan outlining how the company will adjust investment strategies to reflect these shifts with stakeholders as well as what specific steps the team is taking to ensure this process is transparent and effective.
