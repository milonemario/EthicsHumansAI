The CFO's concerns about negative investor reactions to a sudden shift to unbiased reporting, potentially harming retail investors, outweigh the ethical improvement of the new policy.  A more gradual transition, with clear communication, might be a better approach.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should present information fairly, avoiding manipulation or intentional bias. While anticipating and addressing potential market reactions is important,  it shouldn't justify deceptive practices.  Consistency and clear communication of any changes in reporting methodology are also crucial to build trust with investors.", "e6": "I would ask about the feasibility of a phased transition to unbiased reporting,  a detailed communication plan to manage investor expectations during the change, and a quantitative analysis of the potential short-term market impact versus the long-term benefits of increased ethical transparency.
