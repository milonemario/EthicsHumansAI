The CFO's concerns about negative market reactions and the potential disadvantage for retail investors are valid.  Maintaining the status quo, while not ideal, minimizes these immediate risks, though a long-term strategy for improving transparency is needed.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, consistent, and fair to all investors.

It should also be understandable to a reasonable investor, avoiding overly complex accounting practices designed to obfuscate.  The potential impact on various investor classes should be carefully considered to prevent unfair advantage or disadvantage.", "e6": "I would ask about the long-term plan to address investor perception of earnings manipulation.
