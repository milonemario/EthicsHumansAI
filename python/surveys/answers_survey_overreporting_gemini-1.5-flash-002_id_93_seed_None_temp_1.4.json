The risk of short-term market reaction to a sudden policy change outweighs the long-term ethical benefit. A phased approach to improved transparency might be preferable.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, consistent, and provides a fair and accurate representation of the company's financial performance.  It avoids intentional bias or manipulation to influence investor perception.  It should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups, aiming for a level playing field, and be compliant with all relevant accounting standards and regulations.  Long-term credibility should outweigh short-term market gains.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the policy change and mitigate negative market reaction.  I'd also inquire about a detailed analysis of the potential impact on various investor groups, including retail investors and hedge funds, to better understand the risks involved in switching policies.
