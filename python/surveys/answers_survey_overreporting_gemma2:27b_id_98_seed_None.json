The current policy of intentionally misrepresenting earnings erodes trust and exposes the company to unnecessary legal risks. Transparency may lead to short-term adjustments but will ultimately build a stronger foundation for sustainable growth and investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  Reported information should truthfully reflect the company's financial performance without manipulation or intentional bias, even if it might lead to short-term unfavorable optics.  Ethical considerations also extend to ensuring all stakeholders have equal access to understandable and reliable information, mitigating potential harm to any group, including retail investors. Open communication with investors about changes in reporting practices builds trust and reinforces ethical conduct.", "e6": "Yes, I would have some follow-up questions: \n\n1.  What data supports the CFO's concern that sophisticated hedge funds would exploit a policy change, and how significant is this impact compared to potential benefits of ethical reporting? \n2. What are the long-term legal and reputational risks associated with continuing the current misrepresentation practice?\n3. Are there alternative strategies we can implement to mitigate the potential short-term market volatility during the transition to a new policy, like targeted investor relations efforts or phased implementation?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "'Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
