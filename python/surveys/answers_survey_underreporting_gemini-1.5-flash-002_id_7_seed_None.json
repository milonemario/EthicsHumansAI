Long-term, building trust with investors through transparency is crucial.  The current policy, while arguably not actively misleading sophisticated investors, is fundamentally deceptive and creates an uneven playing field.  The risks of the new policy are outweighed by the ethical benefits and the potential for increased long-term investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents financial information fairly, without manipulation or intentional obfuscation.  It should be consistently applied, readily understandable to investors of all levels of sophistication, and avoid creating unfair advantages for certain investor groups.  It should also consider the potential impact on different stakeholder groups and strive for fairness and equitable access to information.", "e6": "I would ask for a detailed plan to communicate the policy change to investors, including how they will address potential market misinterpretations.  I'd also inquire about the potential financial impact of the change, including both short-term market reaction and longer-term implications for investor relations and capital raising.  Finally, I'd want to understand how they will ensure consistent application of the new policy and prevent any future manipulation of earnings reports.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
