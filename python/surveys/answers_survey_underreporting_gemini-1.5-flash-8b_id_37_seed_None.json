While the CFO's concerns about investor reaction and potential harm to retail investors are valid, the ethical implications of the current policy outweigh these considerations.  Transparency and honesty build long-term investor trust, which is crucial for the company's value and success.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading or manipulating information, even if it might seem beneficial in the short term.  Considerations include the potential impact on various investor groups (retail vs. institutional), the long-term reputation of the company, and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  Crucially, the policy must be consistently applied, fostering trust and predictability in the market.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask for a detailed analysis of the potential negative impact on retail investors from the new policy, including specific strategies for mitigating those concerns (e.g., investor education programs).  I would also want to know the specific metrics and strategies that will be used to track and manage investor perceptions, reactions, and the resulting market impact.
