The CFO's concerns can be addressed by effectively communicating the revised financial reporting policies to investors, thereby ensuring fairness for all parties involved.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and not involve deception or bias. The current policy involves underreporting earnings by 50 cents and creating a known bias for investors to adjust upward, which is unethical. A change to an unbiased reporting policy is essential to avoid legal liability and foster investor trust. Considerations appropriate to the context include fairness among all investors, consistent performance, transparency in communicating changes, minimizing potential harmful effects on retail investors, and protecting against negative earnings surprises.", "e6": "Yes, I would have a few follow-up questions for the management team. Firstly, regarding legal counsel's concerns about potential legal liability or an investigation by the SEC, ask for more details and clarify their reasoning to determine if changes in financial reporting policies are necessary to mitigate these risks. Secondly, to address investor relations team's concerns about credibly communicating a change in policy, ask how the management can ensure transparency during this process and what measures they plan to establish to educate investors on the new unbiased reporting policy. Lastly, to assess the CFO's claim that retail investors would be disadvantaged by this change, request data or evidence supporting their assertion, so as to consider alternative solutions ensuring fairness for all groups of investors in both the short and long term.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
