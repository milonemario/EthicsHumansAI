The potential for investor confusion and negative reaction outweighs the ethical advantage of full transparency in this context.  A more nuanced approach, such as a phased implementation or clear communication strategy, might be warranted before switching to the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading stakeholders, whether through deliberate manipulation or unintentional ambiguity.  Considerations like the sophistication of investors, the potential impact on different investor groups (retail vs. institutional), and the overall market context are crucial.  A transparent policy, while potentially disruptive in the short-term, builds long-term investor trust and maintains the integrity of the company's financial reporting.  Lastly, a truly ethical policy requires careful consideration of how the policy will be communicated and what the company's duty of care is to the different stakeholder groups.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask for a detailed analysis of potential market reactions to the policy change, including projected short-term impacts on stock price and potential trading advantages for various investor groups.  Further, I'd want to understand the management team's communication strategy for explaining the change to investors, especially retail investors, and mitigating any negative consequences. Finally, I would inquire about the feasibility of a phased implementation or a transitional period to allow for a smoother transition to the new policy.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
