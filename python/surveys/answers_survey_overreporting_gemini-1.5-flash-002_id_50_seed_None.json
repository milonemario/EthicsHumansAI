Long-term, transparent reporting builds stronger investor trust, which is more valuable than short-term gains achieved through deceptive practices.  The risk of short-term negative market reaction is outweighed by the benefits of ethical reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and consistently applied.  It avoids intentional manipulation or obfuscation of information, providing a fair and unbiased representation of the company's financial performance.  It also considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, not just shareholders, and adheres to all relevant accounting standards and regulations.  Contextual factors such as investor sophistication should inform communication strategies but not justify misleading practices.", "e6": "I would ask about their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, including how they will address potential short-term market reactions and educate investors about the new, unbiased reporting.
