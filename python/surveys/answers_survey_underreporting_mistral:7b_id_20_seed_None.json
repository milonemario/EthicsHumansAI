The potential legal and ethical risks associated with the current practice outweigh any short-term benefits.

As a board member, it is crucial to consider ethical practices in addition to financial gains, ensuring that all stakeholders, including less sophisticated retail investors, are treated fairly.", "e6": "For clarity on the current policy, I would ask management to explain how they communicate the consistent under-reporting of EPS and what steps have been taken to educate retail investors about the need for upward adjustments.
