The CFO's concerns about investor perceptions and retail investors being hurt by the change outweigh the benefits of unbiased reporting. A more nuanced approach could be explored to balance transparency with investor sensitivity, such as gradual phase-out or education initiatives.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and free from bias or manipulation. It should also consider the potential impact on stakeholders, including investors who may have different levels of sophistication or understanding. In this context, transparency about the policy's intent, potential biases, and any necessary adjustments allows investors to make informed decisions. Additionally, policies should prioritize fairness and equity, avoiding practices that could unfairly advantage or disadvantage certain groups. By balancing these characteristics, a reporting policy can maintain trust and credibility with stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 5, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 5, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "2011 AQ21 (also known as 3D)", "q10": "B"}
