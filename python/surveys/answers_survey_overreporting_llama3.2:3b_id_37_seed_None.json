While sophisticated investors may understand the adjusted earnings, small investors may be more vulnerable to making suboptimal investment decisions.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, honest, and consistent. It should clearly disclose any adjustments made to reported earnings and provide a clear understanding of how they are incurred. The policy should also consider the needs and expectations of all stakeholders, including retail investors. Additionally, it should be free from manipulation or bias that could impact the decision-making process of users. In this context, the current policy's transparency around the 50-cent adjustment is an ethical characteristic, as investors understand the bias and can adjust their expectations accordingly.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask additional questions to clarify the potential implications of implementing a new policy, such as how the company plans to communicate changes to the policy and their expectations around adjusted earnings, what support mechanisms will be put in place for retail investors who may struggle with these adjustments, and whether there are any alternative solutions that could balance the need for transparency with the concerns around legal liability.", "e7": "Against", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 4, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 AG5 (also known as Tempel 1, also known as Comet Hartley 2/2011 A1)", "q10": "B"}
