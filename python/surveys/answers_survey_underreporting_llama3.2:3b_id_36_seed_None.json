On the other hand, the practice has been well-understood by investor community and will be adjusted for in the market, ensuring that these investors remain unaffected. Meanwhile, sophisticated hedge funds are already attuned to this adjustment. Given this delicate balance, I believe maintaining the status quo minimizes potential harm while still catering to more informed investors.", "e5": "A favorable reporting policy should provide clarity and transparency while minimizing manipulation or omission of material information. Ideally, it should accurately reflect a company's performance without creating artificial expectations or incentives that could lead to decisions based on incomplete data. Furthermore, a policy should consider the interests of diverse stakeholders, including both retail and sophisticated investors. It should also be reasonably understandable by all parties concerned, allowing for informed decision-making and minimizing potential harm caused by inadequate disclosure.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask about the monitoring process to ensure that sophisticated investors adjust their expectations accurately, given the company's reporting policy. Additionally, I would like to know more about the potential risks and consequences of maintaining or changing this policy on retail investors' portfolio performance and overall stakeholder interests.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 1, "e": 2, "f": 5, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
