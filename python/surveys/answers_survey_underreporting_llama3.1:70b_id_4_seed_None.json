Although some investors may initially react negatively due to unfamiliarity with the unbiased EPS, the long-term benefits of accurate reporting outweigh the short-term risks. This change aligns ABC with best practices, reduces potential legal liability, and promotes a stronger reputation for integrity and accountability.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial performance without intentional misrepresentation or omission of material facts. Considerations include consistency in application, avoidance of misleading information, and fairness to all investors. Additionally, the policy should be easily understandable, regularly reviewed for compliance, and aligned with regulatory requirements and industry standards. In the context of ABC, ethical reporting also involves considering the potential impact on different types of investors, such as retail versus sophisticated investors.", "e6": "Yes. I would like to ask the management team to provide more information on their plan for communicating the change in policy to investors, especially regarding how they intend to educate retail investors who may not be aware of the previous bias in reporting.
