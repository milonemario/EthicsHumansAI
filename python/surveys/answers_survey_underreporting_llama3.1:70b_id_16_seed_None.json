Although some investors may be initially misled, this change eliminates potential biases and misinterpretations in the long run. It also reduces the risk of regulatory scrutiny and maintains a positive corporate image. Temporary market reactions can be managed through effective communication about the policy change. Overall, a fair and truthful reporting practice is essential for building trust among stakeholders and promoting sustainable business growth.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should clearly convey the company's financial situation without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. Considerations include consistency in application, avoidance of selective disclosure, and provision of sufficient context for informed decision-making. Additionally, an ethical policy would prioritize fairness to all stakeholders, including small investors, and not favor specific groups like sophisticated hedge funds. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy promotes trust, accountability, and responsible business practices, which are essential for long-term sustainability and prosperity.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask how management plans to communicate the change in policy to investors and analysts, particularly those who may not be aware of or understand the implications of the new unbiased reporting approach.
