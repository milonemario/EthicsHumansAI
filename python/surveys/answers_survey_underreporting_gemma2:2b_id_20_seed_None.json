This could lead to volatility in market expectations, ultimately impacting investor confidence and potentially facing legal scrutiny. Maintaining transparency through clear communication with investors will help ensure a smooth transition to a new policy, while preserving public trust.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes full, accurate disclosure to market, while minimizing potential harm.  It should avoid misleading investors with manipulated data *or* creating false expectations for future performance based on bias. Transparency in these practices cultivates trust and avoids long-term regulatory scrutiny or legal troubles stemming from inconsistent operations. The focus should always be grounded in ethical behavior that serves both the company *and* stakeholders.", "e6": "While the current policy has served for years, potential changes to reporting could raise questions regarding how long this may take.  Understanding their reasoning for moving away from bias-driven reporting and what processes are in place should be a priority during this transition. Are there any plans for risk assessment prior to implementation? This question would help determine if these proposed changes align with the company's overall vision in long term strategic planning.", "e7": "Against", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 5, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "The first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system is designated **", "q10": "B"}
