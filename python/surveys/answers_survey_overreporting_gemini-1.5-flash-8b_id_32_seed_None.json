Maintaining a transparent reporting standard, even if it means initial market adjustment, fosters trust and long-term investor confidence, which is crucial for the company's long-term health.  The current policy, despite investor awareness, is inherently deceptive, which is a significant risk to the company's reputation and future.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.
