This outweighs the potential benefits of transparent reporting, leading me to recommend not changing to the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should clearly present financial information without intentional bias or manipulation, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. Considerations such as potential consequences of change, impact on investor groups, and the company's reputation also come into play. In this context, the CFO's concerns about market reaction and retail investors suggest that any policy changes must carefully weigh these factors against the benefits of transparent reporting.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask: What specific metrics or criteria do you propose for evaluating the success and fairness of the new policy after its implementation?
