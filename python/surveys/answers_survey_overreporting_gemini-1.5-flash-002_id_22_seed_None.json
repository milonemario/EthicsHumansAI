The long-term benefits of transparency and building investor trust through honest reporting outweigh the risks of a temporary market downturn.  A change to the new policy demonstrates a commitment to ethical conduct and may even lead to greater investor confidence in the long run.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deliberate misrepresentation of financial data.  It considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors of varying sophistication.  Fair presentation, even if it leads to short-term market fluctuations, is crucial for building long-term trust and investor confidence.  Compliance with relevant accounting standards and regulations is also paramount.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to employ to communicate the policy change to investors. I would also want to understand their assessment of the potential short-term market impact and how they plan to mitigate any negative consequences.
