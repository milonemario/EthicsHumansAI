While the new policy carries a risk of temporary misinterpretation, the long-term benefits of increased transparency and ethical conduct outweigh this risk.  A company should prioritize building trust based on honesty and accuracy, which will ultimately prove more valuable than short-term market fluctuations due to misunderstanding.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading or deceptive practices, even if seemingly advantageous in the short term.  Considerations include the potential impact on all stakeholders (investors, employees, customers) and the long-term reputation of the company.  A truly ethical policy builds trust through consistent, truthful communication, fostering long-term value over short-term gains.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask about the specific methods used to arrive at the current biased earnings figure, the projected impact of the new policy on various investor groups (e.g., retail vs. institutional), and a detailed plan for communicating the policy change to investors to mitigate potential negative market reactions.
