While some investors might initially be misled, the benefits of transparency and honesty in financial reporting outweigh the potential short-term costs. Additionally, changing to the new policy reduces the risk of legal liability or regulatory scrutiny associated with consistently over-reporting earnings.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial performance without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. Relevant considerations include consistency in application, comparability across periods, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, an ethical policy should prioritize fairness and avoid favoring specific investor groups over others. In the context of ABC company, this means providing earnings per share (EPS) that reflect true financial performance, rather than relying on a biased metric that may mislead some investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. What specific steps does management plan to take to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and analysts? How will the company ensure that all stakeholders understand the implications of the new policy on reported earnings? Are there any plans to provide additional guidance or training to investor relations teams to address potential confusion among retail investors?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
