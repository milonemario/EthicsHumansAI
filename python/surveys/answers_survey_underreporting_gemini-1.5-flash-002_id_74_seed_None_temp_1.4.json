It presents a complete and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any intentional manipulation or obfuscation.  It also considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, ensuring equal access to information and avoiding practices that could unfairly advantage some investors over others.  Consistency in application over time is also critical for maintaining trust.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market impact of switching policies.
