Even if some investors initially misunderstand the change, the ethical transparency of the new policy outweighs the potential short-term market reaction and the risk of future investor mistrust.  It is better to build a strong, sustainable relationship with investors founded on honesty and integrity.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any deliberate manipulation or misrepresentation, even if investors might initially misinterpret the information.  Fairness to all stakeholders, including both sophisticated and retail investors, is crucial.  The policy should be consistently applied, avoiding the appearance of selective reporting based on short-term goals.  Ultimately, the policy must promote trust and confidence in the company's financial statements.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about the specific anticipated investor reactions to the new policy, including potential short-term market impacts.  I'd also inquire about the mechanisms the investor relations team has in place to educate investors about the change and address any concerns, including how the team plans to mitigate the potential for sophisticated investors to take advantage of retail investors.  Finally, I'd want to understand the potential impact on employee morale and motivation given the change in reporting practices.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
