While more transparent, it could lead to investor confusion and potentially negative short-term market reactions.  The current policy, despite its ethical shortcomings, has a proven track record of managing investor expectations. A careful assessment of potential impacts, including a comprehensive communication strategy, is crucial before making such a significant change.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and truthfulness.  It should avoid misleading investors, even if done unintentionally.  Full disclosure of material information, consistent application of accounting principles, and a demonstrable commitment to accuracy are key.  Crucially, the policy should be designed to foster trust, not just manage short-term market reactions.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd want to understand the potential magnitude of negative investor reaction to the new policy and the proposed communication strategy to mitigate that.  Also, what are the specific risks to retail investors if the new policy is adopted, and what steps are being taken to mitigate those risks?
