Switching to the new policy aligns the company with higher ethical standards, promoting transparency and investor trust in the long run.

It should also consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, not just investors, and strive for consistent application of accounting principles.  Clear communication of the reporting methodology is crucial for building trust.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific methods used to bias earnings under the current policy,  the potential impact on different investor groups (beyond retail vs. hedge funds), and a detailed plan to communicate the policy change to investors to mitigate negative market reactions.
