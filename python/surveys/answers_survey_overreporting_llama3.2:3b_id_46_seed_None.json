Currently, small retail investors adjust for the known bias, but they may not be able to do so under the new policy. Sophisticated hedge funds might actually benefit from the change, further exacerbating the issue. Instead, I would consider alternative solutions that address the concerns of both retail and institutional investors, such as gradual phase-out of the bias or transparency around the adjustment process.", "e5": "A fair and ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and consistency. It should clearly disclose any biases or adjustments made to-reported figures, allowing investors to make informed decisions. The policy should also avoid material misrepresentations that could impact investor decisions or create market anomalies. Furthermore, the policy should consider the potential impact on different classes of investors, including retail and institutional investors, ensuring that no group is unfairly disadvantaged. Additionally, the policy should be subject to regular review and revision to ensure it remains fair, consistent, and in line with relevant regulatory requirements.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to request clarification on the following points:\n\n- How will the company plan to address potential market disruption and unequal treatment of investors under the new policy?\n\n- What steps are being taken to ensure that retail investors understand the adjustment process and can incorporate it into their investment decisions?\n\n- Are there plans to establish clear guidelines or industry standards for similar reporting policies in the future?\n\nThis will help inform our decision-making as a board and ensure the new policy aligns with the company's values and responsibilities to its stakeholders.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 1, "e": 4, "f": 5, "g": 4, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Siding Spring)", "q10": "B"}
