The CFO's concerns about retail investors being harmed by the change to an unbiased policy are valid, but so is the argument that transparency and honest reporting are essential for long-term trust and reputation. The impact on sophisticated hedge funds versus retail investors must be carefully weighed. It may be desirable to explore alternative solutions that balance competing interests, such as providing clear guidance on how to adjust reported earnings.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes honesty, transparency, and accountability. A key characteristic is accuracy - reports should reflect a true and fair representation of the company's performance and position. Additionally, the policy should consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors, customers, and employees. It should also be free from any manipulation or bias that could distort the overall picture. Furthermore, the policy should facilitate clear communication and provide sufficient guidance for users to understand the reporting methodology and any adjustments they need to make.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more detailed information on how investors can adjust for the bias in the current reporting policy, and what specific guidance or resources would be provided to help level the playing field between sophisticated hedge funds and retail investors. Additionally, I would seek clarification on whether there have been any changes requested by investor groups or industry associations that could inform our decision-making process.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 AG5 (also known as Lumina, also known as 2010 TK35/2011 AG5)", "q10": "B"}
