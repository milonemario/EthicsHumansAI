While some investors may initially be misled, ultimately, unbiased reporting will benefit both the company and its investors by fostering trust and confidence. The potential short-term volatility is outweighed by the long-term advantages of transparent reporting. Additionally, complying with regulatory requirements and avoiding potential liabilities are also compelling reasons to adopt the new policy.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and free from bias. The policy should clearly and accurately reflect the company's financial situation, without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. Considerations such as regulatory compliance, investor protection, and long-term sustainability are also important. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should be consistent, fair, and unbiased, treating all stakeholders equally and avoiding favoritism. In the context of ABC's situation, adopting a policy that aligns with these characteristics will promote trust, credibility, and confidence among investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions. Specifically, I would ask management to provide more details on how they plan to communicate the policy change to investors and stakeholders to minimize potential misunderstandings and volatility.
