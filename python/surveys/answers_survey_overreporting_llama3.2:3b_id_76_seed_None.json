The risks of changing to the new policy, including harming retail investors who rely on the pre-existing understanding of the EPS bias, outweigh any potential benefits.

It should also consider the needs of all stakeholders, including retail investors who may rely on consistent narratives. An ethical reporting policy would prioritize fairness, accountability, and trustworthiness, while also taking into account the need to balance disclosure requirements with the complexity of financial reporting. Ultimately, a fair and accurate representation of financial performance is essential, and any policy should aim to achieve this objective rather than advance organizational interests at the expense of user confidence.", "e6": "Yes. I would like to ask follow-up questions about the proposed changes and their impact on various stakeholders, such as retail investors, institutional investors, and the company's reputation.
