Changing the policy without sufficient explanation or guidance risks losing investor confidence. Additionally, allowing some sophisticated investors to take advantage of unaware retail investors seems unlikely to have major negative implications overall.", "e5": "In an ethical reporting policy, I would look for honesty and transparency, meaning the firm reports actual results that align with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) without bias or misrepresentation. Another key characteristic is fairness, where similar situations are handled consistently to maintain investor trust and confidence in publicly traded companies' financial statements. This would involve periodic explanation of past biases if transitioning to an unbiased reporting policy to avoid shocking investors in earnings releases and financial disclosures.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask what criteria or assumptions are made about investors when assuming some can handle unbiased earnings while others might be confused or disadvantaged by it? How does management propose to address potential unintended negative consequences and provide ongoing transparency regarding these processes? Can there be regular review points in place by board committees for future discussions about policies if this change leads to unexpected or undesired effects?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "C", "q6": "C", "q7": "A", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
