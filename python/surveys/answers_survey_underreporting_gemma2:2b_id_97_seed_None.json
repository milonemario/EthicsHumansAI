This could result in unforeseen market volatility. We should continue our current practice of reporting earnings biased within the framework of legal compliance as we try to establish transparent communication with investors.

It shouldn't mislead investors, but instead acknowledges that inherent biases exist within financial reporting.  A transparent policy that allows for adjustment over time fosters investor confidence. Openly discussing the history of past biases (and their impact, if any) to address potential market anxiety builds trust through transparency, which ultimately leads to sustained long-term value creation.", "e6": "I would like to explore the potential long-term impact of this new policy on investor engagement.
