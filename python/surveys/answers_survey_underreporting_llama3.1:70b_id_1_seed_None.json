The current policy of consistently under-reporting earnings by $0.50, although well-understood by some investors, could be perceived as misleading or deceptive. By adopting a no-bias policy, ABC would ensure that all stakeholders have access to accurate and reliable information, promoting fairness and trust in the market.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and consistent. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant financial information to stakeholders, without intentionally misleading or omitting critical details. Additionally, the policy should be applied uniformly, avoiding selective disclosure that favors certain groups over others. In the context of publicly traded companies like ABC, considerability should also include compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards. Furthermore, the policy should prioritize fairness and equal access to information for all stakeholders, including retail investors who may not have the same level of sophistication or resources as institutional investors.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more information on their plan for communicating the change in policy to investors, analysts, and other stakeholders. Specifically, I would like to know how they intend to ensure that all parties are aware of the change and understand its implications, including any potential temporary impacts on the stock price. Additionally, I would ask for their strategy for addressing any concerns or questions from retail investors who may be disproportionately affected by the change.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
