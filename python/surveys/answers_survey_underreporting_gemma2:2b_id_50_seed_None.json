The company needs to consider if their earnings management and manipulation tactics contribute to long-term sustainability as it risks legal issues in order to establish trust with investors. This should be coupled with an honest explanation regarding past practices, future transparency, and a comprehensive strategy for achieving ethical accounting moving forward.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy represents a commitment to fairness and transparency for all stakeholders, including investors. It prioritizes integrity by honestly reflecting underlying financial performance, acknowledges past inaccuracies if they exist, implements safeguards against manipulation or bias, and fosters trust through clear communication of future intentions. This avoids creating artificially inflated expectations while upholding accountability in the long run.", "e6": "Following up with management about steps already taken on these strategies would be necessary to understand where a shift is needed. For example, if their previous communication strategies have failed to create confidence in the financial reporting process, addressing methods to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of those efforts going forward might be crucial.
