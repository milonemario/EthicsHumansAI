It should present a complete and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any manipulation or selective disclosure of information to benefit certain stakeholders.  It should also comply with all applicable laws and regulations and be consistently applied.  Furthermore, an ethical policy considers the impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may lack sophisticated financial knowledge.", "e6": "I would ask about the specifics of the investor relations plan for communicating the policy change,  how they will mitigate the short-term market reaction, and  what steps will be taken to educate retail investors about the new, transparent reporting.
