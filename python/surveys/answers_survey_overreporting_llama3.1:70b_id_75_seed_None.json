By adopting unbiased reporting, the company demonstrates transparency, honesty, and a commitment to integrity, which can foster trust among stakeholders, reduce liability risks, and ultimately contribute to sustained success. This outweighs the potential short-term costs, making it a strategic decision that prioritizes the company's reputation and longevity.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it prioritizes transparency, honesty, and accuracy. This means clearly disclosing all relevant information, avoiding biased or misleading presentations, and ensuring that stakeholders have access to reliable data. Additionally, consideration should be given to the potential impact on various stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, and the broader community. In the context of financial reporting, this may include disclosing potential risks, uncertainties, and material weaknesses, as well as taking steps to prevent misleading or manipulative practices that could harm investors or other stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. What is the estimated timeframe for implementing the new policy and re-educating employees? How will you ensure consistency in reporting across all departments and teams?
