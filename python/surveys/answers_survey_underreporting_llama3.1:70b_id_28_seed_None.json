Although some investors may initially be confused by the change, it's better to take a short-term risk of potential punishment from the market than to continue with a policy that could expose the company to legal liability or an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. By switching to unbiased reporting, the company demonstrates its commitment to integrity and accountability.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and honesty in financial reporting. This means providing clear, unbiased, and comprehensive information that allows investors to make informed decisions. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should be consistent, reliable, and free from manipulation or omission of material information. It's also essential to consider the context, including the potential impact on various stakeholders, such as retail investors versus sophisticated hedge funds. Furthermore, a company should strive to adhere to regulatory requirements and industry standards, while also maintaining a commitment to integrity and accountability in its financial reporting practices.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions. Specifically, I would like to know more about the potential risks and consequences of implementing the new policy, such as any expected impact on stock price or investor relations. Additionally, I would ask for clarification on how the company plans to communicate the change to investors and address any confusion that may arise from the shift in reporting practices. It would also be beneficial to understand the timeline and plan for implementation, including any necessary training or resources required for employees involved in financial reporting.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (previously named A/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
