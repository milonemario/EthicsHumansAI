Although the current policy is well-understood by investors, it still presents a risk of being misinterpreted or leading to regulatory issues in the future. Changing to the new policy may lead to short-term consequences, such as a decline in stock price, but it will ultimately build trust with investors and reduce the risk of reputational damage. Furthermore, honesty is essential for maintaining credibility and integrity, which are crucial for long-term success.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that financial reports should clearly and truthfully reflect the company's performance, without attempting to mislead or deceive stakeholders. The policy should also be consistent and dependable, allowing investors and other users of the information to make informed decisions. Additionally, the policy should prioritize fairness and equality, ensuring that all stakeholders have access to the same information and are treated equally. In the context of publicly traded companies like ABC, timely disclosure of material information is also crucial to maintain a level playing field.", "e6": "Yes.
