The CEO's warning about hedge funds trading at an advantage against these investors also raises concerns. The stability and predictability provided by the current policy justify sticking with it, even if it means being viewed as potentially deceptive to some extent.", "e5": "A reporting policy should aim for transparency, honesty, and fairness. Ethics dictate that reported information must accurately reflect a company's financial situation, without misleading or deceiving investors. Additionally, policies should avoid perpetuating self-serving practices, such as 'cooking the books' to benefit certain groups at the expense of others. Considerations like context depend on factors like industry norms, regulatory requirements, and stakeholder sensitivities. In this case, the existing bias in the reporting policy has become so ingrained that its revelation might do more harm than good. Transparency is essential in complex situations.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask the management team about their approach to addressing the issue of bias in the reporting policy. Specifically, what measures will be taken to ensure that all stakeholders can access and understand financial information without feeling pressured or misled by the pre-existing bias? Additionally, how will they communicate these changes to employees who may have invested years in learning and applying this biased framework?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 1, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Siding Spring)", "q10": "B"}
