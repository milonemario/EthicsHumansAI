Changing to an unbiased policy may lead to investor confusion, especially among retail investors who are less sophisticated. The CFO's concern about punishment in the market due to a perceived bad performance is also valid. By keeping the practice transparent, investors can make more informed decisions while minimizing potential harm to small investors.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, honest, and fair. It should be free from biases and misrepresentations that could deceive or mislead investors. The policy should also take into account the diversity of investor sophistication and needs, ensuring that all investors are treated equally and have access to accurate information. Additionally, a company's reporting policy should prioritize integrity over short-term gains, demonstrating long-term commitment to trustworthiness and accountability.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask: How do you plan to inform retail investors about the changes in the reporting policy and ensure they understand the shift from a biased EPS to an unbiased one? Additionally, what steps will be taken to address concerns from larger institutional investors who may have existing strategies or benchmarking related to the previous bias?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 1, "f": 5, "g": 2, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 CQ1, also known as comet Lovei/2011 CQ1", "q10": "D"}
