However, some investors will mistakenly assume that reported earnings are biased downward, potentially causing losses for them and gains for savvier investors in the short term. Only over time, as a 'lag' in investor understanding plays out, will accurate calculations lead to more long-term stability and profitability; even then fairness benefits could remain uncertain depending on how other firms respond or compete.", "e5": "In an ethical reporting policy, I'd look for clarity of truth, consistency in execution, and fairness towards various stakeholders. It should not mislead or unfairly benefit specific groups at the expense of others.
