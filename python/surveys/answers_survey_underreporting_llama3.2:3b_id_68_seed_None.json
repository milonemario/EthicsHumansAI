Retail investors have come to expect the $0.50 bias and may be hurt by changes in earnings reports if they don't adjust their expectations accordingly. In contrast, retaining the current policy ensures a consistent narrative for some investors, who understand the bias and can make more informed decisions.

It should provide consistent and understandable financial information that enables investors to make informed decisions. Transparency is essential, particularly when significant adjustments are made, such as the $0.50 bias in this case. The policy should also consider the potential impact on investor groups, including retail investors who may be less aware of market nuances.
