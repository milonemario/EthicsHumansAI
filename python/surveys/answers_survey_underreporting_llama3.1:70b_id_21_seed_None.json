Providing unbiased earnings per share (EPS) will give investors a clearer understanding of the company's performance, even if some investors may initially be surprised or adjust their expectations. This change aligns with the company's responsibility to provide accurate information and reduce potential liability risks.

It should provide stakeholders with complete and unbiased information, enabling them to make informed decisions. This means avoiding manipulative or misleading tactics, such as artificially inflating or deflating financial results. Additionally, the policy should be clear, consistent, and easily understandable by all stakeholders, including both sophisticated and unsophisticated investors. It's also important to consider the potential impact on vulnerable groups, such as retail investors, who may not have equal access to information or resources.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team.
