While fully unbiased reporting would benefit credibility and transparency, considering that investors anticipate this bias for years may create difficulties.

It requires an approach that balances clear communication and shareholder responsibilities, contributing to overall market trust.", "e6": "I'd like to understand more about investor communication plans.
