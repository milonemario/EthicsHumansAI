The new policy promotes transparency and long-term trust with investors.  Although a short-term stock price dip is possible due to investor misinterpretations, the increased ethical integrity and reduced risk of future scandals justifies the change.  Open communication about the policy change to investors can help mitigate the negative market impact.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and consistently applied.  It avoids any intentional manipulation or misrepresentation of financial data, even if it might lead to short-term negative market reactions.  It should also consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors of varying sophistication, and strive for fair and equitable treatment.  Complete and timely disclosures are vital.", "e6": "I'd ask about their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, including strategies to educate investors about the new, unbiased reporting.  I'd also want to understand the potential impact on different investor groups and how management intends to mitigate any unfair advantages gained by sophisticated investors during the transition. Finally, I would ask for a detailed analysis of potential short-term and long-term financial consequences.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
