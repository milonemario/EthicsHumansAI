The current policy, though seemingly accepted by sophisticated investors, is inherently deceptive and risks long-term damage to the company's reputation and investor confidence. The new policy, while presenting initial challenges, is the more ethical and ultimately sustainable choice.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and fairness.  It ensures that all relevant information is disclosed completely and without bias, allowing investors to make informed decisions.  It should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups, aiming to avoid creating situations where some investors are unfairly advantaged.  Consistency and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles are also key components.", "e6": "I would ask about a detailed plan to manage investor communication during the transition to the new policy, including how they will proactively address potential misunderstandings and mitigate negative market reactions.
