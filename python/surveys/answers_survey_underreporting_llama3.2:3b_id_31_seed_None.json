Instead, I propose exploring alternative solutions that balance transparency with Investor protection, such as providing clear disclosures about the historical bias in EPS or phasing out the 50-cent adjustment over time.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethically sound when it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should avoid any practice that could mislead or deceive investors, particularly retail investors who may not be as sophisticated. Additionally, a policy should consider the potential impact on different types of investors, minimize harm to those who are most vulnerable, and maintain a reasonable balance between competition for investment opportunities and protecting investors' interests. Ultimately, the policy should prioritize honesty, clarity, and long-term accountability over short-term gains or convenience.", "e6": "Yes, particularly regarding the potential risks and consequences of adopting a new policy that would require significant changes to how investors perceive and react to the company's financial reporting.
