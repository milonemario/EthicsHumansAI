While the transition to a bias-free new reporting policy poses challenges, the negative implications and lack of transparency are detrimental in their long-term consequences for the ABC Company.", "e5": "Ethical reporting policies in this case should prioritize transparency, clarity, and fairness toward all investors. Considering the consistent practice of biased earnings reporting in ABC, the new 'unbiased' policy can enhance investor trust and protect the firm from potential legal consequences by offering accurate financial information.

I would like more details about how current retail investors are taking earning adjustments and if education about the change can be provided when needed. Additionally, I would further explore strategic communication plans for credibly conveying the updated no-bias earnings reporting policy to avoid negative impact on investors.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "D", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": [">=11/19/17 - 12/15/2014 Oumuamua", "<b>or</b>: <=8/14/83 Borisov (tentative)"], "q10": "D"}
