While there is risk that some investors might incorrectly assume past earnings were even lower than adjusted, this change does not benefit anyone from continued secrecy around actual financial performance. Further investigation into hedge fund concerns was deemed insignificant as 'small impact'.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that promotes transparency and accuracy. It should clearly disclose relevant and timely information, avoiding ambiguities or intentional omissions that could mislead stakeholders. The policy should prioritize fairness and respect for all parties involved, including investors with different levels of sophistication or resources. Furthermore, considering the impact of such policies on smaller or less experiencedinvestors is an additional measure to ensure ethics.", "e6": "Yes, two follow-up questions.  Firstly, have we considered collaborating with or educating investor relations teams in communicating adjustments to our newly unbiased earnings, specifically highlighting this would help experienced investors understand the accounting change without perceived loss? If retail investors get lost after correcting historical EPS how will company account for these losses versus potential long term revenue and what other communication plan may better serve stakeholders?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "A/2017 U1 (also known as 'Ohmakuneh' or Oumuamua)", "q10": "C"}
