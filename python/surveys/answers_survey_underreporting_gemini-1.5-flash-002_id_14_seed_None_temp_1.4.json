Although a short-term market downturn might occur due to investor misinterpretations, the long-term benefits of transparency and building trust far outweigh this risk.  The current policy, while not explicitly deceptive, operates in a gray area.  Adopting the new policy demonstrates a commitment to ethical accounting practices, strengthening investor confidence in the long run.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents financial information fairly, without intentional bias or manipulation, aiming to give investors a clear and unbiased view of the company's performance.  Materiality is key; omissions or misrepresentations of significant information are unethical.  The policy should be consistently applied and easily understandable to avoid misleading investors, regardless of their sophistication level.  Legal compliance is a fundamental ethical requirement.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific communication plan for announcing the policy change to investors.  I'd also want to understand the analysis supporting the assumption that investors would adjust earnings upward by 50 cents, along with a risk assessment of the potential negative market reaction and strategies to mitigate that impact.  Finally, I'd want to see a detailed comparison of the costs and benefits, both financial and reputational, of both the current and proposed policies.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
