Maintaining the current policy, despite its inherent ethical flaws, seems more prudent given the company's short-term financial needs and the complexity of investor reaction to a sudden change.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors through manipulation or omission.  Considerations include the potential impact on various investor segments (e.g., retail vs. institutional), market volatility, and the overall long-term health of the company's reputation.  Above all, the policy must be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and uphold a standard of fairness to all stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask for a detailed sensitivity analysis of potential market reactions to the policy change, specifically examining the impact on different investor types (retail, institutional, etc.). I'd also want to know if the estimated 50 cent bias in the current policy is based on concrete, verifiable data, and what steps have been taken to mitigate risks for retail investors. Lastly, what contingency plans are in place to address negative market consequences, particularly given the need for equity raises in the near future?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
