The overreaching fear of a temporarily dip in stock price or short-term perceived downward adjustment by some hedge funds pales in comparison with a long term commitment to ethics and transparent financial transactions with investors. Addressing current shareholder concerns regarding the fairness of such practice will strengthen investor relations while enhancing trust across all investment groups.", "e5": "An ethical financial reporting policy, especially for ABC company, should be fair and transparent to ensure investor equality. In order to meet high ethical standards, I see an unbiased reporting method being critical for shareholder equity and overall industry integrity. Although it may pose potential short-term problems due to the misperception or ignorance of the bias from certain groups such as retail investors, it provides a more stable long term perspective by offering uniformity among all stakeholders and less opportunity for any insider exploitation. Ultimately addressing legal liabilities and enhancing public trust must be paramount in adopting and applying these ethical principles.", "e6": "As the board member, I would request specific data regarding the potential advantage of sophisticated, attention hedge funds over retail investors from the change in financial reporting. Clarify whether there is evidence or statistical significance to support this potential imbalance. Secondly, determine if the current discrepancy in EPS can be resolved by further educating retail investors on biased earnings rather than perpetuating biased reported performance. Lastly, provide analysis examining investor reactions toward perceived biased earnings policies versus transparent, no bias reporting policies through stock price volatility or trading frequency.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Comet Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
