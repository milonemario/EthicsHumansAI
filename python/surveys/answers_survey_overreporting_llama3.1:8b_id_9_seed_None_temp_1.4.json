Furthermore, changing the policy could lead to financial losses, as suggested by retail investor behavior, creating an unfavourable outcome, prompting a No recommendation for the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be truthful, transparent, and free from bias. When investors have already anticipated adjustments to known biased information (as in this case), adopting a completely unbiased approach could still cause harm by causing investors familiar with the historical figures to initially mistrust or react negatively to what would become true reports. Therefore, I'd consider policies that prioritize fair reporting but also mitigate potential negative consequences on stakeholders who might be unaware of the existing bias.", "e6": "Yes.
