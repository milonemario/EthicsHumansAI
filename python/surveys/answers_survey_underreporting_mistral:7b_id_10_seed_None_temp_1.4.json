Although the current policy has been consistently followed and mostly understood by investors, I believe the firm should adopt the new unbiased reporting strategy to mitigate any future legal or regulatory consequences. It's crucial that the board communicate this change clearly to avoid misunderstandings within the investor base and minimize potential disruptions. To protect retail investors as well, management could consider communicating the change to the policy to create a level playing field between sophisticated and unsophisticated investors.", "e5": "Reporting policies should strive for transparency, veracity, fairness, and the protection of stakeholder interests. In this context, an 'ethical reporting policy' that upholds these qualities would: (i) Provide unbiased, accurate representations of financial performance to foster informed decision-making and to reduce potential liabilities or reputational damage; (ii) Treat every stakeholder in a fair manner, ensuring an equal opportunity for all investors, from large hedge funds to small individual retail investors; and (iii) Fully disclose the company\u2019s financial performance practices to help investors navigate investment choices while protecting small, unsophisticated investors against exploitation. Moreover, board members must prioritize shareholder welfare beyond immediate profits when making important recommendations.", "e6": "The response from the CFO raises several important and relevant questions concerning the potential consequences of both changing the present financial reporting policy as well as sticking with the current practice. One area deserving deeper exploration is understanding to what extent small and unsophisticated retail investors actually adjust the reported earnings upwards by 50 cents. The board should commission a survey or study with investor samples across different levels of sophistication to verify that the assumption holds, as discrepancies may favor larger, sophisticated investors at the cost of smaller ones. Additionally, a deeper conversation regarding potential mitigating measures to level the playing field between retail and institutional investors is important. For instance, providing transparent reasoning in the earnings announcements or issuing informative materials for the new policy might help alleviate unnecessary disadvantages from small investors. It would be interesting to further examine if alternative channels could exist for providing financial information to specific demographic segments based on their sophistication and investment needs.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "D", "q6": "B", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": null, "q10": "D"}
