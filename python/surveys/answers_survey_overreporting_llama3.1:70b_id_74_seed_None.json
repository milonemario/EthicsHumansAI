Although some investors might be initially confused, the benefits of honest reporting outweigh potential short-term consequences. The current policy's bias may not be misleading now, but it could lead to issues with regulatory bodies or future investors who aren't aware of the adjustment. By changing to the new policy, ABC company demonstrates its commitment to integrity and sets a positive tone for its financial reporting practices.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It should clearly present financial information without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. Considerations for an ethical policy include avoiding biases or manipulations that could influence investor decisions, ensuring consistency in reporting methods to facilitate comparison and analysis, and providing context to help stakeholders understand the reported data. Additionally, ethical policies should consider the needs of diverse stakeholders, including retail investors who may not have the same level of sophistication as institutional investors, and strive to ensure equal access to information.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to clarify how they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors, particularly retail investors who may not be aware of the adjustment. I would also like to know what steps the company will take to ensure that all stakeholders have access to accurate and consistent information during the transition period. Additionally, I would ask for an estimate of any potential costs or resources required to implement the new reporting policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
