It is essential to ensure reliable, transparent, and legal reporting for safeguarding investor trust and complying with SEC regulations. I recommend changing to a new honest policy even if a temporary adjustment in stock price might follow.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should strive for transparency and accuracy, avoiding both intentionally misleading information and omissions that can lead to ambiguity. It is crucial for a board member to prioritize investor trust by ensuring the financial reports are reliable and compliant with regulations. The current practice of over-reporting the earnings per share (EPS) raises legal concerns about transparency, which could undermine long-term reputation and attract unwanted scrutiny from regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). To promote fairness among investors, it is essential to make sure no advantage is gained by any group over others through biased reporting. Therefore, a policy change to no-bias earnings reporting can help maintain fairness among investor groups, ensure long-term reputation, and reduce the risk of regulatory investigations.", "e6": "Considering CFO's apprehension related to share price volatility due to unbiased reporting affecting retail investor trust over sophisticated hedge funds; it is important to clarify if the new policy includes an accompanying transparent communication strategy in place, aimed at addressing investor concerns fairly and effectively.

When can retail investors reasonably expect to observe the results of a potential adjusted earnings reporting, and thus better financial transparency?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "A", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
