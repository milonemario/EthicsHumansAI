Communicating a change to an unbiased policy is crucial for long-term success, investor trust, and mitigating risk. Acknowledge the short-term market volatility risks and focus on addressing these concerns through effective communication with investors. Implementing measures to protect retail and non-sophisticated investors from being exploited by hedge funds can help alleviate those immediate worries.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and consistent, with the primary goal of faithfully representing the firm's financial performance to shareholders. Relevance, reliability, comparability, timeliness, and understandability are essential aspects that contribute to achieving these goals. Any reported bias or under-reporting may compromise investor trust and expose the company to regulatory scrutiny. By considering the impact on small, retail investors in this context, it is crucial to prioritize fairness in reporting practices to prevent potential exploitation by more sophisticated entities.", "e6": "As a board member, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team to ensure that it is taking an ethical and responsible approach to this issue. First, I would ask if legal counsel has conducted a thorough review of the current policy against existing regulations and potential legal risks. Second, I want to know if the company has considered communicating clearly with investors about the change in reporting policy, emphasizing accuracy and transparency while reassuring investors that the firm remains a strong, trustworthy investment option. Third, I would seek information on measures the firm intends to put in place to safeguard small, retail investors against unscrupulous hedge funds. Lastly, I will request evidence-based insights into how the market has rewarded or punished similar companies that have transitioned towards more transparent financial reporting practices.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "E", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "The answer to this scenario question is not relevant to the choices provided.
