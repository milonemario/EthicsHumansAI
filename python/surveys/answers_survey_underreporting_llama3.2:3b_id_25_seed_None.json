The new policy would essentially shift the problem from visible to hidden, making it harder for smaller investors to navigate the market. Given this, I believe that the current policy, although imperfect, is a more transparent and predictable approach for most investors.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical if it provides transparent and accurate information, respects market expectations, and minimizes harm to stakeholders. In this case, the current policy's bias is a recognized aspect of the firm's accounting practice, which investors anticipate and adjust for. An ideal policy would balance transparency with fairness, considering the needs of all investors, particularly small ones who may be more vulnerable to negative surprises.
