However, I am also cautious about continuing the current biased policy if there is no evidence that investors are being misled. The decision depends on weighing the potential benefits of transparency against the risks of unintended consequences and unequal treatment for different investor groups.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that provides transparent and accurate information to stakeholders, without hiding or distorting material facts. This means being honest about estimates, uncertainties, and limitations of financial data. A balanced approach is also necessary, where management does not mislead investors about the company's strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, a transparency plan should be in place to explain how accounting policies are made and implemented, including any potential biases or subjectivity. Ultimately, the policy should prioritize trustworthiness and reliability over expedience or short-term gains.", "e6": "Yes. I would like to ask the management team several follow-up questions, including how they intend to address concerns about sophisticated investors potentially trading against smaller investors under the new policy.
