Changing the policy could lead retail investors to believe that reported earnings are more accurate, but they still adjust for the historical bias in reverse. This could result in a disproportionate impact on smaller investors who lack the resources and knowledge to adjust for this bias alone. In contrast, under the current policy, all investors, including sophisticated hedge funds, can accurately account for the 50 cents bias. I prioritize fairness across all investor groups when making my recommendation.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and honesty, while also considering the diverse needs of various stakeholders. It should clearly disclose any biases or distortions used in earnings reports, and provide a clear baseline for investors to work from. Additionally, it should take into account the varying capacities and resources of different investor groups, aiming to minimize disproportionate harm to vulnerable parties. The policy should also demonstrate a commitment to fairness and accountability, both within the company and towards external bodies such as regulators. Ultimately, an ideal policy would balance competing interests while maintaining trust with investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to clarify the company's plans for investor education and communication in the event of a policy change. Additionally, I would like to understand more about the proposed safeguards to protect retail investors from potential market disruptions.
