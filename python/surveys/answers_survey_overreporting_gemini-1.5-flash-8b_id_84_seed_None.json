The new policy, though potentially causing short-term market fluctuations, is more transparent and aligns with ethical financial reporting practices.  Long-term investor trust and confidence are more valuable than short-term gains achieved through deception.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors, even if it might result in short-term market volatility.  Crucially, the policy must be consistently applied, avoid manipulation, and be understandable to the intended audience.  Consideration must be given to the potential impact on various investor types and the overall market integrity.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd ask about the specific methodology used to calculate the 50-cent adjustment and how it was justified. I'd also want to understand the potential market impact (beyond the immediate short-term) of the change, and their contingency plans to mitigate any negative effects on retail investors.
