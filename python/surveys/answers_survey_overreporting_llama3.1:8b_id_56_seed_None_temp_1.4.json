The policy change's benefits in easing investor relations outweigh any perceived concerns about misleading investors or encouraging more sophisticated players against smaller investors in trading, given existing understanding among savvy investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would be transparent, honest, and clear in its intention. In this case, the old policy was secretive about its bias and potentially misleading, while the new policy is truthful but might cause market confusion unless investors understand the change. Ideally, a policy should avoid actions that only serve institutional or corporate interests and benefit investors with better knowledge. An ethical board would prioritize investor transparency over corporate interests.", "e6": "I would like to understand what mechanisms the organization could put in place to minimize potential confusion or information imbalances among investors in adopting a new, unbiased policy.
