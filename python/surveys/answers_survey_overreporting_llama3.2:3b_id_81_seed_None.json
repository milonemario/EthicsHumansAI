On the other hand, sophisticated investors such as hedge funds might benefit from this change, but their impact on the market is difficult to quantify and may not justify harming the broader investor base. Therefore, I would recommend withholding a vote to change the policy, instead opting for exploration of alternative solutions that balance competing interests in a way that minimizes harm to retail investors.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical if it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and minimal deception. It should provide clear guidance on how to interpret financial reports, avoiding biases or manipulations that could mislead stakeholders. Additionally, the policy should consider the potential impact on different investor groups, particularly retail investors who may lack specialized knowledge. An ethical reporting policy would also promote fairness, consistency, and accountability, while being mindful of regulatory requirements and Industry standards. In this scenario, the current policy's bias for sophisticated investors highlights the need for a more balanced approach.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to elaborate on their confidence that retail investors will adjust their expected earnings by 50 cents even if they know about the new policy. Additionally, I would inquire about any potential mechanisms to ensure a smooth transition and minimize market disruption when introducing the new policy, such as clear communication channels or investor education programs.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "2017 UF 12", "q10": "B"}
