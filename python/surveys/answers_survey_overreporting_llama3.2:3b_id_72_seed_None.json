The current policy allows them to adjust their expectations and make informed decisions, whereas the new policy may lead to unrealistic expectations and short-term market volatility. As a board member, I prioritize transparency and fairness for all stakeholders, including the most vulnerable investors.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical when it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and clarity. It should provide stakeholders with reliable and informed information that reflects the company's true financial performance.

The policy should also balance competing interests, such as avoiding legal liability versus maintaining investor confidence. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy fosters trust and stability in the market, thereby contributing to long-term sustainability and growth.", "e6": "Yes. I would like to discuss the potential implications of changes in accounting practices on our relationships with institutional investors, such as hedge funds, which appear to understand the current bias and adjust their strategies accordingly.
