However, such an inequitable playing field must be addressed and not reinforced by continued deceptive practices. Long-term growth might see retail losses offset. By working closely with IR to minimize potential harm via education and transparent messaging on new policy, we protect the firm's reputation, integrity and maximize the benefit to both retail and sophisticated investors.", "e5": "In order to have an ethical reporting policy, transparency and honesty are essential. Falsely underreporting earnings can expose a company to legal risk, damage investor trust, and foster cynicism within the wider investment community. While there's awareness in the existing market regarding bias adjustments, it remains concerning that such practices can lead to trading imbalances against retail investors in favor of sophisticated traders. Adapting to an unbiased reporting method should be a priority, as long-term interests are served by promoting fairness at all investing tiers.", "e6": "To gain a better understanding of ABC company's present circumstances and future prospects, I have some questions for management. Firstly, could you elaborate on the company's plans for addressing retail investor protection, given the CFO's concern that sophisticated hedge funds may exploit the market inefficiency created by current biased reporting policies? Secondly, what initiatives are being considered to minimize potential negative earnings surprises, ensure financial stability and effectively communicate the change to a no-bias policy to all investors, including retail investors? Lastly, will there be further analysis on the long term impact of continuing such a practice while balancing short-term market volatility against adopting ethical financial reporting practices?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "This scenario is about a decision-making process with ethical implications. However, it doesn't have a direct answer for an interstellar object that passed through our solar system.
