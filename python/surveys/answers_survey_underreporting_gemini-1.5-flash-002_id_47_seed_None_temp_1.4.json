While the current policy avoids short-term negative market reactions, it's ethically problematic.  The new policy, despite potential short-term market volatility, promotes long-term trust and reduces the risk of larger ethical breaches.  The potential for some investor misunderstanding is outweighed by the benefits of transparency and integrity.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness to all stakeholders.  It should provide a complete and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any intentional manipulation or misrepresentation.  Clear and consistent reporting methods, along with readily accessible information, are crucial for building investor trust.  The policy should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups, striving to prevent any group from gaining an unfair advantage.", "e6": "I would ask about the specifics of their investor relations plan to mitigate the short-term market reaction to the policy change.  I'd also inquire about the steps they plan to take to educate investors on the new reporting policy, ensuring that all investors have equal access to understanding the change.
