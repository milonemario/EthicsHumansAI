While the new policy improves the accuracy of financial reporting, it may disproportionately harm retail investors who are less financially savvy and rely on the predictability of the EPS bias. I would recommend exploring a compromise solution that mitigates these concerns while still adopting more accurate reporting practices. This could involve providing clear disclosures or explanations to retail investors about the change in policy or offering additional support to help them adapt to the changes.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should avoid misleading or deceiving investors with deliberate misrepresentations that are widely anticipated and adjusted for. Instead, policies should aim to provide clear and reliable information that enables informed decision-making.

Ultimately, an ethical policy balances the need for accurate reporting with the need to protect financial markets from manipulation or exploitation.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 4, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "C", "q9": "2017 U1N2 (", "q10": "B"}
