The current policy, although well-understood by investors, is biased and may expose the company to regulatory risks. Switching to unbiased reporting would reduce this risk and provide a more accurate representation of the company's earnings. While there may be short-term challenges in communicating the change to investors, the long-term benefits of transparency and honesty outweigh these concerns.", "e5": "For me, an ethical reporting policy is one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It should provide a clear and unbiased representation of the company's financial performance, without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. Considerations include avoiding conflicts of interest, respecting investor reliance on reported information, and complying with regulatory requirements. Additionally, policies should be applied consistently and without favoritism, ensuring fairness and equality among all stakeholders. In the context of this scenario, an ethical reporting policy would prioritize providing accurate and unbiased earnings per share (EPS) to investors, aligning with best practices in financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to clarify and ensure a smooth transition. Specifically, I would ask: What is the proposed plan for communicating the change in reporting policy to investors and other stakeholders? How will the company address potential short-term market volatility or reaction to the new reporting policy? Are there any specific steps being taken to educate or retrain staff on the importance of transparent and accurate financial reporting?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
