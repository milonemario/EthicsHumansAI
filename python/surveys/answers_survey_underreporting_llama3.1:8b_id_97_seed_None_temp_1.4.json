This change could lead to investor confusion and market unpredictability that outweighs any potential benefits from a no-bias approach.", "e5": "In assessing the ethics of a reporting policy, I would consider factors such as transparency, accuracy, consistency, and fairness. A policy that clearly discloses known biases or methodologies, is implemented consistently over time, and is transparent in its accounting practices demonstrates higher ethical standards. In this context, it's also relevant to consider how different investor groups might be affected by a change in reporting policy, particularly those with more limited access to information or smaller financial portfolios.", "e6": "I'd have follow-up questions such as: What would be implemented to prevent hedge funds from 'working ahead' of retail investors if transparency is gained through new policy? Is this a problem of disclosure or execution? Are the potential risks and downsides associated with changing to zero bias accounting worth implementing more sophisticated processes for hedging?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 1, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
