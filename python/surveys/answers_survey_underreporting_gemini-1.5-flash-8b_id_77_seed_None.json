While short-term market fluctuations might occur, the long-term benefits of ethical conduct, and a reputation for accuracy, outweigh the possible short-term market reaction to a change in policy. Maintaining investor trust through accurate reporting is ultimately more valuable than manipulating earnings to maintain a short-term positive perception.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or bias, ensuring reported financial data accurately reflects the company's performance.  This includes clear disclosure of accounting methods and any potential impacts on the reported results.  Furthermore, the policy should consider the potential for misinterpretation by investors and strive to minimize that risk while maintaining the integrity of the reporting itself.", "e6": "Yes, I'd ask about the specific anticipated market reaction to the change, the potential for investor education programs, and whether a phased implementation of the new policy is possible to mitigate short-term disruption.
