The CFO's concern about retail investors being disadvantaged and the market punishing the company for an assumed poor performance outweighs the long-term ethical benefits of transparency.  Maintaining consistency in the current earnings presentation, even if it's not perfectly transparent, is crucial for investor relations in the short term.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, presenting financial information fairly and consistently.  Crucially, it avoids misleading investors, whether intentionally or unintentionally.  This includes clear disclosure of any accounting methods, adjustments, or assumptions, allowing investors to make informed decisions without being manipulated.  Consideration must be given to the company's specific circumstances, including investor sophistication, market conditions, and the potential impact of the reporting policy on various stakeholders, particularly in the context of ongoing fundraising activities.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed sensitivity analysis of potential market reactions to the new policy, including scenarios where investor understanding varies.  Specifically, how will the transition be communicated to investors?  What specific safeguards are in place to mitigate any potential harm to retail investors, and how will the company monitor and measure the impact of this new policy on different investor groups?  Finally, what is the long-term strategy for investor communications regarding the new reporting policy?  These questions would help assess the potential risks and benefits of the proposed change and inform a more informed decision.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
