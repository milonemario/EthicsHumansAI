Regardless of any short-term advantages to maintaining the status quo among sophisticated investors, it would be advisable for ABC board members to initiate timely changes in financial reporting policies toward greater transparency and honesty. Investor protection regulations and adherence to trust are essential components in ensuring credibility for the company's financial performance over time.", "e5": " An ethical reporting policy must promote honesty, transparency, and adherence to regulations, which should be communicated to all investors while accounting for potential consequences on specific groups. In this scenario, the practice of underreporting earnings per share is unethical as it jeopardizes public trust, exposes the company to investigation or litigation by proper authorities and potentially harms retail investors through market exploitation based on informational asymmetry.", "e6": "I would ask the CFO for more specific examples and detailed explanations about the potential negative repercussions of changing the current policy and under what circumstances these issues came up. It would be helpful to know if similar situations transpired in the past and what adjustments were made to address them, particularly since continuing this practice could potentially exacerbate a lack of investors' trust and expose the firm to legal risks with uncertain outcomes.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "B", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
