The CFO's concerns about investor relations and market impact are valid. In contrast, the current policy ensures that most investors can accurately adjust reported EPS to estimate true earnings. Given these considerations, I would recommend maintaining the status quo and keeping the existing policy, which balances transparency with a widely understood adjustment.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent and free from material misrepresentation. It should provide adequate context for stakeholders to understand the reported information. In this case, the current policy's bias is a well-established and widely understood adjustment, allowing investors to accurately estimate true earnings. The new policy's lack of clarity and potential negative impact on retail investors make it less desirable. Ethical reporting policies also consider stakeholder interests, such as investor protection and market integrity, and balance competing requirements like transparency and competitiveness. Clear communication and reasonable adjustments are key aspects of an ethical policy.", "e6": "I would like to discuss potential mitigation strategies for the negative consequences of adopting the new policy, such as investor education programs or adjustments to disclosure requirements.
