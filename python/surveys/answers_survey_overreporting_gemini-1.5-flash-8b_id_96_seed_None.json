The potential for investors to misinterpret the true earnings and negatively react to the change, especially considering the need for future equity raises and impact on retail investors, outweighs the advantages of transparency.  A more measured approach, perhaps involving communication and investor education, should be considered before implementing the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors, even if unintentionally, by presenting a fair and unbiased view of the company's financial performance.  Considerations like investor sophistication, the potential impact on different investor groups (especially retail vs. institutional), and the long-term health of the company's stock price must be weighed.  Finally, the policy must clearly and consistently reflect the company's true financial situation, avoiding any manipulation or creative accounting practices.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions about the potential magnitude and duration of the negative market reaction to the new policy, alternative communication strategies to mitigate investor concerns, and detailed data on the historical impact of the existing bias on stock prices and investor sentiment.
