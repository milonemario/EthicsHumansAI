Withholding essential information due to prior management's deception, although seemingly providing short-term advantages for ABC company, may subject the firm to significant reputational risk in the future. Thus, prompt modifications like transitioning to an unbiased reporting system for financial stability is preferable. Establishing the right communication mechanism to guide informed investor decisions that minimises market instability also proves crucial.", "e5": "In an ethical reporting policy, honesty, integrity, and accountability are paramount. It should strive to provide unbiased data to enable informed decision-making by the investor community. Confidentiality must be observed, ensuring no undue advantage or disadvantage is given to some market participants over others. Additionally, the ethical considerations demand that policies not discriminate against any investor groups. In this specific instance of ABC's consideration to revise its bias in EPS reporting, a truly ethical approach should protect both retail and institutional investors by being transparent about any changes and avoiding misleading practices.", "e6": "As a follow-up, I would question about feasibility in terms of market impact and public relations. How will our communication changes accommodate unbiased reporting so that investors have a clear understanding of the change to ensure both sophisticated and retail investor populations do not face disadvantageous outcomes for unanticipated adjustments caused by earnings surprise? Also, I would express empathy with the dilemma that management faces but insist that ethics remain a core foundation. In-depth market analysis must be conducted exploring how small investors could potentially access advantages in a no bias environment along with implementing education initiatives to keep retail investors knowledgeable. Lastly, consider working directly under guidance from regulatory bodies such as SEC while implementing a transparent change policy without placing unfair advantage.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": {"interstellar object with first detection": "\u02bbOumuamua", "year of first detection": "2017"}, "q10": "D"}
