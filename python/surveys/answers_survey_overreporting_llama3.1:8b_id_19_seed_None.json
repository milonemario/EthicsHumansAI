Therefore, the risk of a downside may outweigh the potential benefits, leading to a recommendation not to change the current policy.", "e5": "In my view, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy. It should present financial information in a way that is honest, clear, and free from bias or misrepresentation. The policy should also ensure equal access to information for all investors, without unfairly benefiting certain groups at the expense of others. Additionally, it's essential to consider the potential harm or benefits to stakeholders, such as small investors or retail customers, who may be differently impacted by changes in reporting policies.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions about the potential consequences of not changing the policy. For example, do you anticipate any legal repercussions or regulatory scrutiny from not changing the policy? How would you mitigate any negative impact on small investors if a hedge fund were to take advantage of them in this situation? What steps could be taken to ensure a more level playing field among different types of investors?", "e7": "Against", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 5, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
