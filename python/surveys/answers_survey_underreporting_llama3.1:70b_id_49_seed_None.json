Although some investors may initially misinterpret the earnings reports, the company can take steps to clearly communicate the policy change. In the long run, this approach will foster trust with investors and reduce the risk of legal liability or regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, it will simplify the financial reporting process and make it easier for management to provide accurate and unbiased information.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, honest, and unbiased. It should clearly communicate financial information without any intentional distortions or omissions. The policy should also be consistent and free from manipulation to achieve specific goals. Furthermore, the company should take steps to ensure that all stakeholders, including investors and regulators, understand the reporting methodology and any changes to it. In this case, considering the context of ABC's plan to raise new equity, an ethical policy would prioritize transparency and accuracy to maintain investor trust and confidence in the company's financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. Can you provide a detailed plan for how you intend to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and other stakeholders?
