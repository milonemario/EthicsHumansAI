In addition, it's essential to protect retail investors, as they may not fully understand the reasons behind the changes in policies.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should value integrity, transparency, and accuracy. This entails providing complete and unbiased financial information to investors without adjustments or deceptive practices for the sole purpose of manipulating stock prices or maintaining a competitive advantage. Although some might argue that current policies are known among sophisticated traders, I emphasize the importance of protecting less-sophisticated investors who may not fully understand the rationale behind adjusting earnings reported by ABC company. Protecting both retail and institutional investors demands unbiased accounting, which builds trust in ABC.", "e6": "As a board member, I would raise several follow-up questions during my dialogue with the management team. Firstly, regarding legal counsel's comments on potential exposure to legal liability or SEC investigation, ask for details of investigations or cases with similar circumstances within the company and industry. Secondly, concerning investor community perception about ABC\u2019s consistent over-reporting practice, elicit specific feedback from interview responses mentioning this concern so I can make an informed decision for the retail and institutional investors alike, including their ability to cope with unexpected financial changes.

The CFO's first sentiment indicates a preference for transparent reporting with no bias, which is important both internally within the company and externally to investors. However, the concern over communicating a shift to unbiased earnings without losing investor confidence is valid in the short run. To minimize the disadvantage that small retail investors might face, the board could consider communicating the change in a phased or gradual implementation approach, thus allowing all investors time to adjust to lower earnings and minimizing the immediate impact on stock prices.
