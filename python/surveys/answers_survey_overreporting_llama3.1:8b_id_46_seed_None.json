He worries about small investors being hurt and sophisticated hedge funds trading at an advantage. As a board member, recommending the change may not benefit shareholders or the company's reputation in the short term.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and consistent. It should avoid any intention to mislead or deceive stakeholders. In this context, the new policy's transparency about using actual earnings per share is more ethically aligned. Considerations like the potential negative impact on small investors and the company's reputation are relevant, but shouldn't compromise the fundamental principle of truthfulness.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to address the potential negative impact on small investors and whether any measures can be taken to protect or support them.
