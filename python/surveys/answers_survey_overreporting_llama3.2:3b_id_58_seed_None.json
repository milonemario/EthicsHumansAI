Ethical policies should clearly communicate all relevant information to stakeholders, including any material adjustments or biases that may impact financial performance or judgments. Transparency in intentions and methodologies is also crucial. In the context of this case, an ideal policy would clearly explain the rationale behind the initial bias, provide a clear transition period for investors to adjust, and be consistently applied across all public disclosures.
