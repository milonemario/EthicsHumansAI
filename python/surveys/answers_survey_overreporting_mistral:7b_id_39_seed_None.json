Retail investors would benefit from protection against potential manipulation and increased access to accurate information.", "e5": "An ethical financial reporting policy prioritizes transparency, objectivity, and honesty to maintain investor trust. Considering the ABC case, a bias-free reporting policy would help ensure that investors have access to accurate information about the firm's performance and growth potential. It is essential for all investors, especially retail investors, to have equal opportunities, and potential discrepancies due to over-reporting could exacerbate their disadvantages in the market. Additionally, changing the reporting policy would demonstrate a commitment to sound corporate governance practices and reduce the exposure to legal risks or investigations by regulatory bodies.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the CFO about the legal and financial consequences of failing to change the policy amid concerns about legal liability or investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, I would inquire about measures that can be taken to ensure fairness for retail investors when adjusting their reported earnings downward by 50 cents under the current policy.
