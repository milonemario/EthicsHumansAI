While changing to a new policy may initially negatively impact share price, it is essential for long-term success and stakeholder confidence. The market adjustment due to the unbiased reporting may create buying opportunities for more sophisticated investors. However, strategies should be developed to protect retail investors from being taken advantage of.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and not mislead stakeholders. In this case, the board must consider investors with varying degrees of investment sophistication including retail investors who lack access to the same information as sophisticated investors. The current practice of over-reporting earnings by 50 cents introduces a bias that creates an unlevel playing field, disadvantaging less knowledgeable or resources-constrained investors while providing those with specialized knowledge an opportunity for unfair advantage. Therefore, it is essential to establish a new policy without bias which upholds the company's integrity and long-term success.", "e6": "I would follow up with questions to clarify the risks associated with maintaining the current policy, including any penalties or consequences for not adopting a more transparent reporting practice. Additionally, I would seek to understand how the board intends to address concerns about sophisticated investors taking advantage of less informed retail investors during any potential period of adjustment in market expectations.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "The first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system was Oumuamua, discovered in 2017.", "q10": "A"}
