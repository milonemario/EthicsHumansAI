In this context, the policy explicitly discloses expectations, rather than deliberately manipulating earnings-per-share (EPS) data to create a certain image or gain competitive advantage. Key principles include: avoiding intentional manipulations of financial metrics; clearly disclosing any adjustments used in reporting accounting figures; maintaining consistency between the information provided and management intentions; preventing situations in which specific clients are exposed unduly; protecting retail investors not directly cognizant as being well aware in advance about this 10 percent underreporting bias.", "e6": "Yes.
