Switching to the new policy fosters trust and long-term investor confidence. While there's risk of initial market reaction, transparent reporting is crucial for a company's sustainable success and reputation. The potential for short-term losses is outweighed by the long-term benefits of ethical practices.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids deliberate manipulation or obfuscation of financial data, ensuring all material information is fairly presented.  It considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors of varying sophistication, and avoids practices that create an unfair advantage for certain groups.  Consistency over time and clear communication regarding any changes to the reporting methodology are also crucial.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market impact of adopting the new policy.  I'd also want to understand their plan to communicate the policy change clearly and effectively to all investor groups, mitigating the risk of misinterpretation.  Finally, I'd want a detailed timeline for implementation, along with a plan for monitoring the market reaction and making adjustments as needed.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
