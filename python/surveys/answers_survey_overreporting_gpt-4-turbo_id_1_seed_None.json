Although there is a risk that some investors might initially misinterpret the unbiased figures, the long-term benefits in terms of regulatory compliance and maintaining investor trust outweigh these temporary challenges. Clear communication about the policy change can mitigate misunderstandings and establish a foundation for more sustainable and ethical business operations.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should embody transparency, accuracy, and honesty, providing stakeholders with an unobstructed view of the company's financial health without any intentional bias or manipulation. It should comply with legal standards and accounting norms, ensuring fairness and equal accessibility of information to all investors. In contexts where policy transitions occur, these should be communicated effectively to prevent misunderstandings and to maintain trust. Additionally, maintaining a consistent approach that treats all investor classes equally to prevent information asymmetry is paramount.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team for a detailed plan on how they intend to communicate the policy change to the investors, particularly focusing on how they plan to educate the retail investors about this change to prevent any misinformation.
