The new policy would ensure honest and accurate reporting, promoting trust among investors long-term.

In this case, the current policy's practice of consistently under-reporting earnings per share (EPS) by 50 cents raises concerns since it misrepresents the true financial state of the company. The new suggested policy, which aims for unbiased reporting, would align with these ethical characteristics. The need to consider investors and maintain long-term trust should not overshadow the importance of an honest reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to better understand the consequences of short-term market reaction for retail investors and potential measures to mitigate their harm when changing the earnings reporting policy.
