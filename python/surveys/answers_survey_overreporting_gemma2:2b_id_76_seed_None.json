The company is relying on misleading public perception. While it would benefit the financial image of ABC and simplify communication from stakeholders, it disrupts long-term accountability by creating a false narrative. Moreover, as previously stated, the decision may require significant effort on communication to adjust behaviors and expectations. A complete reset, coupled with proper disclosure of the situation's true implications is necessary. This should be undertaken in compliance with legal frameworks and internal ethical guidelines.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would prioritize long-term accountability and transparency. It wouldn't mislead stakeholders, but instead aim for clear disclosure under consistent principles. This includes providing a neutral perspective while also addressing the impact of prior choices on future planning and performance.
