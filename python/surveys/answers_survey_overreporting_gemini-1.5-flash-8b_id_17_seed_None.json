The current policy, though seemingly understood, is inherently deceptive.

It avoids misleading investors, regardless of perceived investor sophistication or potential short-term market reactions.  Full disclosure, clear communication, and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles are paramount.  Consideration must also be given to the potential impact on different investor groups, and the policy should strive to minimize potential harm, especially to retail investors.", "e6": "Yes.
