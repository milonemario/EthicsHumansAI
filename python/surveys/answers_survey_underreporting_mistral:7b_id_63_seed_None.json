Although there are short-term consequences of changing the current policy to one without bias, it will contribute to long-term credibility for the company. The CFO's concern about small investors being disadvantaged emphasizes this fact, as they should be protected from potential misinformation. By discontinuing the practice of underreporting earnings, the firm can avoid legal liability and demonstrate ethical leadership.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be objective, transparent, and based on principles of honesty, fairness, and accuracy. The primary purpose of earnings reports is to provide accurate and comprehensive information about a company's financial performance to its shareholders, potential investors, and other stakeholders. In context, a biased earnings reporting policy, like the one under discussion, could potentially lead to legal complications and compromise investor confidence due to incomplete or inaccurate information. The CFO\u2019s concerns about impacting retail investors and creating an uneven playing field emphasize the need for a policy that prioritizes transparency and eliminates potential conflicts of interest. By being consistent, clear, and committed to fairness in reporting, ABC's leadership could demonstrate ethical integrity and credibility while minimizing disadvantages for all investors.", "e6": "In light of the legal counsel's concerns about potential liability and the CFO expressing reservations about market reactions to changing the current policy, it would be essential to explore several follow-up questions with management: 1) What measures have you taken to ensure that a potentially biased reporting practice does not mislead shareholders or investors? 2) Have you considered alternative methods to maintain consistency for unsophisticated retail investors and still communicate the change in policy effectively? 3) How can equity funds be incentivized or educated on the new earnings reporting practices without placing undue advantages against small investors?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "B", "q4": "A", "q5": "A", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "This response does not apply as it asks for an answer irrelevant to the actual question", "q10": "D"}
