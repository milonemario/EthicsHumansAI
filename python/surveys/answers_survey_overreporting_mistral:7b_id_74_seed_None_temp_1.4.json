Although changing to an unbiased reporting policy may pose temporary risks, such as potential share price fluctuations due to reduced overstatement, implementing this change sets a precedence that encourages transparency, accountability, improved investor trust and upholding the integrity necessary for sustaining shareholder value in both the short and long run.", "e5": "An ethical earnings reporting policy accurately reflects a company's financial performance without deliberately misleading or obscuring essential information for short-term gains. Inconsistencies in recording practices expose stakeholders, both retail and sophisticated institutions, to unfairness, market manipulation risks, heightened regulatory oversight due to suspicion of possible deceitful conduct, and diminished investor confidence in the company's management competence and credibility that may negatively impact sustained business performance and shareholders value.", "e6": "In addition to my questions as previously stated, I would also want to understand their specific objections to providing more accurate financial reporting. Factors related to increased workload and credibility concerns for the communications team are plausible; however, there should be clear evidence that avoiding change due to fear of being punished by the market or concern about disadvantaging retail investors lacks substantiation. Further exploration of evidence surrounding these stated fears along with any additional unintended consequences as a result of continuing an inherently biased financial reporting practice seems warranted.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "This question is unrelated to the scenario of the ABC company's financial reporting decision.
