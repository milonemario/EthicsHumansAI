A comprehensive plan for investor communication, highlighting the reasons for the change, mitigating potential investor anxieties, and demonstrating the long-term value proposition of the change is needed before recommending the policy change.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors, even if unintentional, and considers the potential impact on various investor groups (e.g., retail vs. sophisticated investors).  Crucially, the policy should be consistently applied and clearly communicated to prevent confusion and ensure fairness for all stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to understand the projected impact of the change on different investor segments, particularly retail investors, through detailed market analysis.  Also, a comprehensive communication strategy for informing investors about the policy change, addressing potential concerns, and demonstrating a long-term commitment to transparency would need to be articulated. Finally, a detailed assessment of the potential short-term market reactions and how management will respond to any negative consequences is needed.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
