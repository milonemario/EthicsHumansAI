Although the current policy is well-understood by investors, it still carries risks of legal liability or investigation. By switching to unbiased reporting, the company can mitigate these risks and maintain a reputation for integrity. Additionally, honest reporting will ultimately benefit all stakeholders, including small investors who may be hurt by the current practice. While there may be short-term consequences, the long-term benefits of transparency and ethical business practices outweigh them.", "e5": "In my view, an ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should clearly present financial information without any intention to mislead or deceive stakeholders. The policy should also consider the needs of all stakeholders, including small investors who may not have access to the same level of information as larger investors. Furthermore, the policy should prioritize compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards to minimize risks of legal liability or investigation. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy should be guided by a commitment to honesty, fairness, and responsible business practices.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team. Specifically, I would like to know what steps they plan to take to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and analysts, and how they intend to manage any potential short-term volatility in the stock price as a result of the change. Additionally, I would ask about their strategy for educating retail investors about the new policy and addressing any concerns they may have.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1), a small, irregularly shaped asteroid or comet discovered in October 2017 by Robert Weryk using the Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii.", "q10": "B"}
