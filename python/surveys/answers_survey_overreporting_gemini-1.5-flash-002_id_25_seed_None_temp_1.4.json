Maintaining transparent and unbiased reporting builds stronger long-term investor confidence and protects all investors, not just sophisticated ones. The initial negative market reaction is a price worth paying for increased ethical integrity.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, ensuring all information is fairly presented without intentional bias or manipulation.  It aims to provide a complete and understandable picture for all stakeholders, regardless of their level of sophistication.  Materiality is crucial; omissions or misrepresentations of significant information are unethical, even if technically legal.  Finally, the policy should be consistently applied over time.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market impact of switching to the new policy.  I'd also want to understand their proposed communication strategy to investors explaining the change, mitigating potential negative reactions.
