The long-term benefits of adopting the new policy outweigh the short-term volatility that might occur due to misinterpretation by investors. The CFO's concerns about sophisticated investors have merit, but they should be addressed through clear and constant communication about changes. Investor education programs could be developed to help level the playing field for retail investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should provide a fair representation of the company's financial performance to all stakeholders and adhere to the principles of transparency, honesty, reliability, and consistency. In this case, the current policy under-reports earnings per share (EPS) systematically by 50 cents, which is problematic since it could lead to potential legal liability or an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The new policy aims to eliminate this bias, but concerns about market reaction should not overshadow ethical considerations. In order to promote fairness, a transparent communication strategy should be developed for investors to clarify the change in policy and minimize any negative impact on retail investors. Education efforts could also help reduce information asymmetries between sophisticated hedge funds and smaller investors.", "e6": "It would be important to address the CFO's concerns about communication and potential negative impact on retail investors.
