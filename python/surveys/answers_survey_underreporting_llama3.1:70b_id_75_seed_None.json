Furthermore, adopting an unbiased policy reduces the risk of regulatory scrutiny and potential liabilities associated with misleading financial reports.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should clearly disclose all relevant information, without intentionally omitting or manipulating data to influence stakeholder opinions.

Furthermore, it should comply with regulatory requirements and be consistent over time, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on reliable information.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team.
