While some investors, particularly retail investors, may initially be disadvantaged due to lack of awareness about the change, it is a necessary step towards greater accountability and honesty. The potential risks can be mitigated through proper communication and disclosure. Long-term benefits, including reduced risk of regulatory issues and reputation enhancement, justify the switch to unbiased earnings reporting.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should provide stakeholders with a clear and truthful representation of the company's financial performance, without intentionally withholding or manipulating information. Considerations such as regulatory compliance, fairness to all investors, and long-term sustainability are also essential. Additionally, effective communication and disclosure of changes in reporting policies can help mitigate potential risks and ensure that stakeholders understand the underlying reasoning. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes honesty, accountability, and the interests of all stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide a detailed plan for communicating the change in reporting policy to investors, analysts, and other stakeholders. This would include explaining how they intend to disclose the change, what timelines they have in place, and what support mechanisms they will put in place to address any potential confusion or questions from stakeholders. Additionally, I would ask them to provide historical financial data under the new reporting policy for comparison purposes.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
