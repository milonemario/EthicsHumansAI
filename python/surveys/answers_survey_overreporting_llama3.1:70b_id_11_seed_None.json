Reporting unbiased earnings per share aligns with our responsibility as a publicly traded company to provide accurate financial information. It also eliminates the risk of exposing the firm to legal liability or an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the long run, this change will build trust with investors and contribute to the company's reputation for integrity.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It should provide a clear and unbiased representation of the company's financial situation, without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. Considerations include avoiding manipulative tactics to influence investor decisions, being mindful of power imbalances (e.g., between sophisticated hedge funds and retail investors), and maintaining consistency in reporting methods to facilitate informed decision-making. An ethical policy also acknowledges potential consequences for various stakeholders and seeks to minimize harm, particularly to vulnerable groups such as individual investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to clarify the potential impact of changing to the new policy. Specifically, I would like to know: What is the expected short-term impact on the stock price and investor relations?

Are there any plans to provide additional guidance or support to help investors adjust to the new policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua, discovered on October 19, 2017, by astronomers using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii.", "q10": "B"}
