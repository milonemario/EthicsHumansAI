Although some investors may initially adjust reported earnings upward out of habit, this will likely correct over time as they understand the change. The current policy, while not intending to mislead, relies on investors being aware of the bias, which can create confusion. By adopting an unbiased reporting approach, ABC promotes a more straightforward and trustworthy financial communication with its stakeholders.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and unbiased. This means clearly disclosing all relevant information, avoiding misleading or deceptive practices, and presenting financial data in a way that accurately reflects the company's performance. In the context of ABC, considerations such as consistency with regulatory requirements and industry norms are also important. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize fairness to all stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers, by providing equal access to information and avoiding any actions that could exploit or mislead certain groups.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to stakeholders, including investors, analysts, and employees. Specifically, I would like to know what kind of transitional guidance or support will be provided to help stakeholders understand the new policy and its implications. Additionally, I would ask about any plans for monitoring and addressing potential misunderstandings or misinterpretations that may arise during the transition period.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
