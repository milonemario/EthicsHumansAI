It should present a true and fair view of the company's financial performance without manipulation or bias.  Relevant considerations include compliance with accounting standards, clear disclosure of all material information, and avoiding practices that could mislead or disadvantage any stakeholder group.  The impact on different investor types (e.g., retail vs. institutional) should also be considered, striving for equitable treatment.", "e6": "I would ask about the detailed plan for communicating the policy change to investors, including how they will address potential short-term market reactions and educate investors about the new, unbiased reporting.
