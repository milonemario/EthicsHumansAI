Transparency, truthful reporting, and investor protection are fundamental principles that should be maintained regardless of short-term consequences. Switching to an unbiased policy may initially face challenges; however, adopting this new policy will create positive expectations for the firm\u2019s future and enable it to attract investors aligned with the firm's values, ensuring a reliable investment opportunity for all stakeholders in a more equitable manner.", "e5": "Ethical reporting policies should accurately and transparently represent a company's financial performance with honesty, fairness, and credibility towards investors. Reporting bias undermines trust within the investment community, creating an unfair marketplace that may lead to legal complications or damaging effects on the reputation of the firm. An ethical policy considers all investors equally and does not favor a specific group while providing clear communication about policy changes and their implications. Furthermore, retail investors must be protected from potential exploitation by sophisticated investors, ensuring that they have access to transparent information in making informed investment decisions.", "e6": "I would follow up with questions regarding transparency, retail investor protection, and the importance of consistent financial reporting. It is essential to question if this bias has been in place for several years because unethical practices jeopardize market consistency and fairness, potentially putting smaller or less-informed investors at a disadvantage when compared to sophisticated ones. To protect these underrepresented parties, I suggest that an honest policy transition is critical to mitigate these issues. I would further inquire about the measures set in place to support retail shareholders during transitory periods and communicate clear messaging through various channels to keep investors informed of any impending changes or modifications to the reporting policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "The first recorded Interstellar Object to pass through our Solar System was 'Oumuamua', discovered on October 19, 2017.", "q10": "D"}
