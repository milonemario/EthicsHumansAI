Despite initial hesitation from the CFO regarding investor relations and potential short-term market volatility, a long-term focus on transparency, integrity, and fairness should be prioritized over maintaining an established yet problematic practice.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy must prioritize accuracy, honesty, and transparency over any short-term market advantages. A bias in earnings without proper disclosure could expose the company to legal liability or an investigation by regulators, compromising trust with investors. Reporting without a bias is essential for accountability and allows stakeholders to make informed decisions based on accurate information. The CFO's concerns, while understandable from a market-valuation perspective, should not prevent ABC from adopting a more ethical policy that prioritizes integrity and fairness over short-term gains.", "e6": "To ensure compliance and protect investors, I would ask for clarifications on whether there have been any investigations or inquiries about the current earnings bias from regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, to further understand the impact of the change in policy on retail investors, I would request data on their investment strategies, understanding of the EPS adjustment, and potential exposure to sophisticated hedge funds with knowledge of the bias.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
