While most investors anticipate and adjust for the $0.50 bias, some retail investors may not understand this adjustment and could be hurt by the change in reported earnings. Furthermore, sophisticated hedge funds that currently benefit from adjusting down by 50 cents might lose their trading advantage, leading to a less favorable market reaction. These risks outweigh the benefits of changing to an unbiased reporting policy.", "e5": "I consider an ethical reporting policy to be transparent, honest, and consistent. It should clearly disclose any biases, adjustments, or methodologies used in preparing earnings reports. The policy should also take into account the needs of all investors, particularly retail investors who may not have the expertise to adjust for biases. Furthermore, an ethical policy would prioritize fairness over short-term gains, ensuring that all investors have access to accurate information and are treated equally. The policy should also be adaptable to changes in market conditions and investor expectations, while maintaining its integrity and trustworthiness.", "e6": "I would like to ask follow-up questions regarding the potential impact of changing the reporting policy on our relationships with retail investors. Specifically, how would we communicate any changes to them, and what support systems would be in place to help them understand and adjust for any biases? Additionally, can you provide more information on how we would monitor and address any adverse reactions from investors after implementing a new policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 4, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "2013 A1 (also known as Oumuamuah)", "q10": "B"}
