This could result in reputational damage and harm to these investors, outweighing any potential benefits from truthful reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It should not intentionally mislead or deceive stakeholders, including investors and the public. Considerations such as the potential consequences of a change in reporting policy on different types of investors, the company's reputation, and the legal implications are also important. A good policy should balance business needs with ethical responsibilities, avoiding harm to vulnerable individuals and upholding the trust placed in the company.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions. Specifically, I'd like to understand what efforts would be made to communicate the change in policy effectively to all stakeholders, particularly retail investors who may not quickly adjust to the new reporting format.
