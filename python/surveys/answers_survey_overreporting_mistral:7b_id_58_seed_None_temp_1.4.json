It may be more challenging to change this deeply embedded practice initially, but it\u2019s essential to prevent legal liabilities and regulatory investigations that could impact long-term growth. Implementing open communication and education to investors will enable mutual cooperation to appreciate the value-oriented benefits brought by this policy restructure", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy values transparency, honesty and consistency. By maintaining financial stability over time through biased overreporting not only misleads investors, it risks incurring legal consequences due to investor reliance on misrepresented information. Furthermore, fairness should concern the potential market impact on small retail investors relative to sophisticated groups while avoiding undermining mutual cooperation with our responsible financial reporting best practices.", "e6": "It is crucial that the members of ABC's board question whether there are other less dramatic policies that could still minimize the burden for investors, such as an incremental move to gradually eliminate pre-existing bias rather than an all at once. They may also explore educating investors, with clear and detailed documentation on earnings adjustments disclosures in the annual reports, on why current policy is changing. It might not only alleviate concerns regarding harming current retail investors and diminishing market trust, it will foster a sustainable reputation that attracts a wider, long-term investor portfolio for future growth.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "A", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "This question is about a discussion on ABC company's financial reporting policy, so it does not have an answer corresponding to the given format.
