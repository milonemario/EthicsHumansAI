As a board member, I am torn between promoting transparency and honesty (new policy), while risking market backlash, versus maintaining the status quo that benefits the company in the short term but may erode trust over time. I need to consider further analysis of potential outcomes, stakeholder interests, and potential risks before making a decision. A balanced approach might involve educating investors about the policy change and monitoring their response to ensure a smooth transition.", "e5": "I would consider a reporting policy ethical if it prioritizes honesty, transparency, and clarity. A key characteristic is that the policy should clearly communicate any material adjustments or qualifications made to financial information. Additionally, the policy should be free from biases and manipulative tactics that could mislead investors. It's also essential to consider the context of the intended audience: sophisticated investors can likely adjust for biases, but retail investors may not be aware. Furthermore, a policy should balance competing interests, such as keeping stock prices strong while maintaining trust among stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions. Specifically, can you provide more information on how the company plans to communicate the policy change to retail investors and hedge funds that may be more susceptible to manipulation by adjusted EPS figures?
