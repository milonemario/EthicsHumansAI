Changing to the new policy without a clear plan to mitigate those risks could negatively impact the company's stock price and investor confidence, potentially outweighing the ethical benefits.  A more thorough analysis of the potential impact is necessary before making a decision.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors through deliberate manipulation or bias.  Considerations include the potential impact on different investor groups (e.g., retail vs. institutional), market reaction to policy changes, and the overall trust placed in the company's financial reporting.  Ultimately, the policy should strive to present a clear and fair picture of the company's financial health without favoring one stakeholder group over another.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed market analysis of the potential impact of the new policy on stock price, a breakdown of how the new policy would affect different investor groups (retail vs. institutional), a plan to communicate the change effectively to mitigate investor anxieties, and a contingency plan for addressing potential negative market reactions.
