The new policy promotes transparency and long-term trust, crucial for sustainable growth. Although short-term market reactions might be negative, building investor confidence through honesty is a more valuable strategy than manipulating earnings.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy. It presents information fairly and without intentional bias or manipulation, even if it means short-term market fluctuations.  It considers all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be less sophisticated.  Furthermore,  a robust policy should clearly explain the methodology used and any limitations.  It should aim to foster trust, not exploit investor behavior.", "e6": "I'd ask about the detailed plan for communicating the policy change to investors, including specific messaging strategies for different investor groups (retail vs. institutional).  I'd also inquire about their risk assessment concerning the potential negative short-term market impact, along with mitigation strategies.
