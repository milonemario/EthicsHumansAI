Though maintaining the bias might seem advantageous for keeping the stock price strong initially, promoting no-bias is ultimately ethically better due its increased transparency under changing accounting norms and for treating investors fairly.", "e5": "A reporting policy must prioritize accountability, transparency, accuracy, and fairness. Considerations include meeting legal standards, protecting investor interests, fostering a long-term vision, and promoting growth backed by strong financials instead of short-term profit-seeking biases. Maintaining consistent practice without an understanding of consequences exposes companies to unwarranted risks such as litigation. Firing back at the CFO's fears, a fair reporting policy doesn't leave any individual or group at a competitive disadvantage. In other words, retail and sophisticated investors alike enjoy equal opportunities through clear and proper communication on financial matters.", "e6": "In consideration of the complexity around reporting policies, one could ask about legal counsel\u2019s specific concerns and if an inefficient market would be less disadvantaged compared to sophisticated investors due to lack of adjustments. It may also be beneficial for the board to explore other alternatives such as a gradual transition, transparent communication strategy, or working with investor communities more closely that acknowledge discrepancies while still following proper financial policies. The emphasis should be made to ensure retail and professional groups receive accurate updates.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 5, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "C", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "In this scenario, the financial decision to be made relates to the reporting of earnings.
