Despite the desire for truthful reporting, the potential consequences seem more significant than any benefit from switching plans.", "e5": "In my opinion, a reporting policy is ethical when it prioritizes transparency, consistency, and honesty. Reporting policies should not intentionally mislead or deceive stakeholders by withholding or distorting information. In an economic context such as described in the ABC scenario, another important consideration for me would be fairness: making all investors on equal footing when evaluating company financials, rather than granting a competitive advantage to informed (or more cynical) ones like institutionalized investors at the expense of less knowledgeable others.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask: What exactly happened two years ago, and why is it that prior management initiated this policy of over-reporting earnings?
