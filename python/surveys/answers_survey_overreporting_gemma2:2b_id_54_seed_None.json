Moreover, delaying a potential change of policy while remaining compliant with regulations like the Securities Act might benefit investors. The most transparent approach is to inform investors that there may be a short-term dip in earnings but will ultimately lead to a stronger long term performance thanks to sustainable business practices. ", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy for publicly traded companies prioritizes accurate and transparent representation of financial performance. It should adhere to clear accounting standards, avoid deliberately misleading investors about earnings, strive to achieve long-term sustainability rather than short-term gains, and maintain full compliance with regulatory expectations like SEC regulations. Open communication with stakeholders about possible market volatility, coupled with well-informed disclosures, demonstrates responsible leadership. ", "e6": "While the current policy is relatively ethical, implementing a new unbiased reporting system would likely face challenges. Before making any policy change, I'd like to understand the extent of potential market volatility triggered by an abrupt shift in earnings disclosures and how we plan to mitigate it.
