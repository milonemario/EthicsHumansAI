Retail investors rely on the bias in EPS to adjust their expectations and make informed decisions about buying or selling shares.

Furthermore, a policy should prioritize fairness and protection of all stakeholders, particularly vulnerable ones like retail investors, over short-term gain or advantages for specific groups. Honesty, integrity, and accountability are also essential characteristics of an ethical reporting policy that balances competing interests and promotes trust in financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes.
