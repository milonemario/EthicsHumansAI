The CFO's concerns about market fluctuation and harm to these investors weigh against the benefits of greater accuracy and transparency, leading to a recommendation against changing policies at this time.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should not intentionally mislead or deceive investors, but rather provide a true representation of the company's financial performance. The policy should be consistent and applied equally to all relevant stakeholders. In the context of publicly traded companies like ABC, consideration of how different groups (e.g., retail investors vs. sophisticated hedge funds) may be impacted by changes in reporting policies is also important. A thorough evaluation of potential consequences on various investor types helps ensure that any policy change maintains fairness and transparency for all.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team. To better understand their concerns and recommendations, I would ask: Can you provide more data on how investors have historically performed when they misunderstood or were misinformed about earnings?
