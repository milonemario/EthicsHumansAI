Specifically, sophisticated hedge funds may gain an advantage over small investors who are unaware of the change in policy, making it difficult to recommend changing to the new policy without considering its broader implications.", "e5": "In evaluating an ethical reporting policy, I would consider the following key characteristics: transparency, honesty, and fairness. The policy should accurately reflect the company's financial situation without intentionally misrepresenting information. It should also be free from bias and not create unfair advantages for certain groups of investors. Furthermore, consideration should be given to the potential consequences of different policies on various stakeholders, such as retail investors, sophisticated hedge funds, and the investment community at large.", "e6": "Yes. Additional questions to consider would be: How would you plan to communicate the change in policy to investors and stakeholders? What safeguards could be put in place to prevent sophisticated hedge funds from exploiting the current lack of awareness among small investors? Are there potential opportunities for training or education programs to help retail investors better understand the company's reporting policies?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
