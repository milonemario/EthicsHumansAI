In the long run, changing to a new policy without bias will foster transparency and build trust among stakeholders, which is crucial for the company's sustainable growth. The investor relations team can address any potential concerns through proper communication strategies.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate and truthful. It must reflect the actual financial performance of the company without any intentional bias or manipulation to mislead investors. Considering the context provided, a policy with no earnings bias would align more closely with these principles. Although the CFO voiced concerns about the change impacting stock prices and retail investors, it's our moral responsibility as board members to prioritize a sustainable, trustworthy relationship with all stakeholders over short-term profit maximization. The investor relations team can manage communication effectively through proper education and awareness campaigns.", "e6": "I would have follow-up questions for the management team to gather more information on a few key points. First, are there any changes or improvements that can be made to the investor relations strategy to ensure effective communication of the new reporting policy? Second, what kind of impact would a change in policy have on retail investors beyond trading at a disadvantage against hedge funds, and could we potentially mitigate this issue through education and regulation awareness campaigns? I'm concerned about the long-term consequences of our decision for all stakeholders, so it's crucial to evaluate different approaches before taking action.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": {}, "q10": "D"}
