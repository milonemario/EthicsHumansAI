The CFO's concerns about investor relations and fairness also point to potential drawbacks of implementing the change.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would be transparent, honest, and not intentionally misleading. It should clearly disclose material information about the company's performance and avoid providing a false impression of reality.

The policy should prioritize fairness and equal treatment of all stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask if there's a plan in place to manage and communicate the change in policy, particularly to help retail investors understand that reported earnings are no longer inflated by $0.50.
