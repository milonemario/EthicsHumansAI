Switching to a transparent, unbiased reporting system, even with a potential short-term market reaction, fosters trust and long-term investor confidence.  This aligns better with the company's ethical obligations and positions it for sustainable success.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and truthfulness.  It avoids manipulation, whether intentional or not, of investor expectations.  Crucially, it considers the impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors, acknowledging their varying levels of sophistication.  Full disclosure, consistent application, and clear communication are key elements for building trust and long-term investor relationships.", "e6": "Yes, I'd want to understand the projected impact of the change on investor sentiment.  Specifically, how will we manage investor relations during the transition, and what mitigation strategies are in place to address potential short-term negative reactions and concerns of smaller investors?  What is the risk assessment for a long-term negative market reaction if we continue with the bias? This includes data on how retail investors might react to a loss of the upward adjustment.
