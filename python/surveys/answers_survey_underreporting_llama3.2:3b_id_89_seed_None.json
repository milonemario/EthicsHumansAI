The new policy may be seen as too simplistic or even misleading if its implications are not understood by some investors. In contrast, the current policy's biases are well-known to all stakeholders, allowing them to adjust expectations accordingly. Changing to the new policy would require investors to adopt a new mindset, which could lead to unintended consequences. I prioritize caution and transparency over potential short-term gains with this recommendation.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical when it prioritizes transparency, honesty, and clarity. It should accurately reflect a company's financial position without misleading or deceiving stakeholders. Ethical policies also consider the potential impact on vulnerable groups, such as retail investors, and strive to minimize risks of exploitation or unfair advantage. Additionally, they should be communicated in a clear, understandable manner, allowing investors to make informed decisions. Finally, policies should be consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, ensuring a level playing field for all stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask a few follow-up questions.
