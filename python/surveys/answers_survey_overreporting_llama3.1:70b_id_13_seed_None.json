This means providing clear and concise information that reflects the true financial situation of the company, without any intentional misrepresentation or omission. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should be fair and equitable, taking into account the needs and interests of all stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the broader community. In the context of public companies like ABC, it's also essential to consider regulatory compliance and the potential impact on market integrity.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions. Specifically, I'd like to know more about the CFO's concerns regarding the potential impact on retail investors and how the company plans to communicate the change in policy to mitigate any negative effects.
