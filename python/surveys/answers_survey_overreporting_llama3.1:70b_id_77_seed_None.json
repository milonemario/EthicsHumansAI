Although some investors might be initially confused, clear communication about the change would minimize this risk. The benefits of honest and transparent financial reporting outweigh the short-term costs of a possible market reaction, ultimately strengthening trust in the company.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information to stakeholders, without intentionally misleading or omitting critical details. Additionally, the policy should be consistent and fair, treating all investors equally. In the context of financial reporting, considerations include compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards, as well as consideration for the potential impact on various stakeholders, such as retail investors who may not have access to the same level of information as sophisticated hedge funds.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. What is the timeline for implementing the new policy, and how will it be communicated to investors? How will the company ensure that all stakeholders, including retail investors, are educated about the change in reporting policy?
