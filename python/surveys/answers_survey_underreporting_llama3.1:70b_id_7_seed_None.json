Although there may be temporary market volatility, a bias-free earnings report will build trust with investors and reduce the risk of regulatory issues. Additionally, it is unfair to smaller retail investors who do not have access to the same information as sophisticated hedge funds. In the long run, adopting an unbiased policy will benefit the company's reputation and relationships with its stakeholders.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and consistent. This means that the policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, without omitting or misrepresenting facts. It should also be free from deliberate distortions or manipulations, and applied uniformly to ensure fairness to all stakeholders. In the context of financial reporting, this includes avoiding practices like earnings manipulation, which can mislead investors and damage trust. Furthermore, an ethical policy would prioritize the interests of all stakeholders, including small retail investors, rather than just catering to sophisticated market players.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to the management team. Specifically, I would like to know how they plan to communicate the change in policy to investors and analysts, what steps will be taken to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the new policy, and what measures will be put in place to monitor the impact of the new policy on the company's financial reporting and investor relations. Additionally, I would ask about their timeline for implementing the new policy and how they plan to handle any potential questions or concerns from regulators.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 3, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
