It prioritizes transparency and integrity over managing investors' perceptions or expectations. In the context of this scenario, this means changing to a new policy that discloses actual earnings, even if it might result in a less flattering portrayal of the company's performance. Transparency, honesty, and credibility are essential virtues in setting trust among stakeholders and promoting well-informed decision-making.", "e6": "Yes. Some questions I'd have for the management team are about investor sophistication and assumptions underlying the current bias adjustment, such as: How accurate or widely assumed is this existing correction adjustment based only on an understanding of past practices (assuming new employees who begin their career with ABC wouldn't know their actual 51c earnings profit), what's being done inside the company around data visualisation and explanation of numbers, to explain to current retail or potential stakeholders as if in school a story explaining your reporting changes ,what has been done internally over its time concerning its transparency of financials (for shareholders), so we feel confident that this approach will result.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
