It avoids deliberate manipulation or misleading statements, even if such actions might seem beneficial in the short term.

Consideration should be given to the potential for unintentional biases to creep into the reporting process.", "e6": "I would ask about the specifics of the investor relations plan to manage the transition to the new policy.
