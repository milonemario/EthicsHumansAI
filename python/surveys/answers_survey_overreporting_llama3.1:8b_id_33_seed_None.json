Furthermore, small investors may be disproportionately hurt by this change, creating a moral hazard for savvy investors who would then have a trading advantage. Given these risks, it is advisable to maintain the status quo of the current policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy, avoiding intentional misrepresentation or omission of information. It's essential to consider the potential impact on different groups, such as individual investors versus institutional traders, and strive for fairness and equity in disclosure. Over-reporting earnings by a fixed amount may seem minor, but it creates an uneven playing field where sophisticated traders can exploit unsuspecting retail investors. A more nuanced approach would be to provide detailed explanations of financial performance and uncertainty, rather than relying on subtle manipulations of reported numbers.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask: What is the total cost and effort associated with changing to a no-bias reporting policy? Would these costs outweigh the potential benefits in terms of improved investor trust and confidence? Are there any regulatory or compliance risks that we might be taking on by moving away from our current policy, even if unintentionally misleading investors?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
