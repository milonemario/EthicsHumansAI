In contrast, the current policy has been transparent and understood by investors, with many already adjusting for the bias. Changing to the new policy could disrupt this understanding and create unnecessary uncertainty. Therefore, I recommend sticking with the current policy.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, consistent, and unbiased. Transparency ensures that stakeholders understand how figures are presented and can make informed decisions. Consistency helps to establish trust and allows for accurate comparisons over time. Unbiased reporting provides an accurate representation of the company's performance, without any manipulation or distortion. Additionally, considerations such as fairness, materiality, and accountability should also be taken into account to ensure that the reporting policy serves the interests of all stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, and the wider community.", "e6": "Yes. I would like to ask management about their plan for educating investors and other stakeholders about the change in policy, should they decide to adopt the new policy. Additionally, I would ask about any potential steps they could take to mitigate potential short-term stock price impacts or harm to small investors. I would also like to know more about the investor relations team's communication strategy to credibly convey the change in policy and address potential concerns.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
