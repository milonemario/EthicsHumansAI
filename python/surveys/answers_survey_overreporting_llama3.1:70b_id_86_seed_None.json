Although some investors may initially adjust incorrectly to the unbiased earnings, this short-term volatility is outweighed by the long-term benefits of honest reporting. Additionally, the new policy reduces the risk of regulatory scrutiny and potential legal liability associated with biased reporting.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, avoiding biases or manipulations that could mislead stakeholders. Considerations include the potential impact on different groups of stakeholders, such as retail investors versus institutional investors, and the long-term consequences of the policy on the company's reputation and relationships with its stakeholders. Additionally, the policy should be consistent with regulatory requirements and industry best practices, and be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure it remains aligned with ethical standards.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask how management plans to communicate the change in policy to investors and stakeholders, including any measures to educate them on the impact of the unbiased reporting. Additionally, I would inquire about potential contingency plans for managing any short-term market volatility resulting from the policy change, as well as metrics or benchmarks that will be used to monitor the effectiveness of the new policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1), discovered in October 2017 by the University of Hawaii's Pan-STARRS telescope.", "q10": "B"}
