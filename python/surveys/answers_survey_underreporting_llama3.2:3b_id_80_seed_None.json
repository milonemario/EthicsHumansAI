The CFO's concerns that some investors may be misled or punished for lower performance in the short term are valid risks. As a board member, my goal is to balance business goals with ethical considerations. Given these concerns, I would recommend exercising caution and monitoring the market's response before making a decisive decision on transitioning to the new policy.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, honest, and reasonable. It should accurately reflect a company's financial performance without intentionally misleading investors. Key characteristics include standardization, consistency, and clear communication of any adjustments or biases involved. Additionally, the policy should be free from conflicts of interest and allow for prompt disclosure of any material changes or issues. Finally, it should balance transparency with fairness to all stakeholders, including retail investors who may not have the same level of attention or sophistication as institutional investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask some follow-up questions. Firstly, how will we ensure that retail investors are able to understand the change in policy and make informed investment decisions? Additionally, what specific measures will be put in place to mitigate the potential negative impacts on investor relations mentioned by the CFO? Finally, have any sensitivity tests or market simulations been performed to gauge the likely effects of the new policy on our company's stock price?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "2013 A1", "q10": "B"}
