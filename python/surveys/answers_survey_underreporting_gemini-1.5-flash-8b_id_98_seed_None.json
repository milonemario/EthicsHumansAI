A sudden shift to unbiased reporting, without a clear communication strategy to the market, could result in a short-term market penalty and disadvantage for smaller investors.  A more measured approach, potentially including a phased transition and robust investor relations plan, would be needed before recommending the change.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It must clearly communicate its methodology to investors, avoiding ambiguity or deception.  Considerations include the potential impact on different investor types (e.g., retail vs. institutional), the company's overall financial health, and the potential for market manipulation or unintended consequences.  Ultimately, the policy should foster trust and confidence in the company's financial reporting, not just meet legal requirements.", "e6": "Yes, I'd want to follow up with the management team on their detailed market analysis regarding potential negative reactions to the policy change. I would also want a more comprehensive investor relations plan to manage the transition.  Further, a breakdown of the anticipated impact on retail investors (e.g., potential strategies to mitigate harm) is necessary.  Finally, how the current policy's benefits (if any) to the company compared with the risks of change should be thoroughly evaluated.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
