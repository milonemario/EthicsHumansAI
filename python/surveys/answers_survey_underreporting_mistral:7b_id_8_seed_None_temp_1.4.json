Admittedly, a short-period decrease in demand due to investor adjustment of reported earnings might occur. However, addressing potential legal concerns can spare ABC from reputational harm in the future; ultimately benefiting all stakeholders, as well as the firm\u2019s reputation as an ethical and lawful organization.", "e5": "Considering our ethical requirements for ABC, a policy should aim for fairness. This would entail honestly conveying ABC\u2019s financial results with appropriate disclosures. In such context, an unbiased reporting policy (either without bias or explicitly stating that reported earnings are systemically undervalued) minimizes investor misdirection through accurate information disclosure. Further emphasis on investor education could help small investors to make informed and balanced decisions.", "e6": "Questions to address the management's concerns on shifting to a new earning policy could be: 1. How are investors being misled if they know that actual earnings should be adjusted by 50 cents upward? Addressing any false information given to certain parties as retail investors might continue following biased reporting under this explanation. 2. Proposing potential alternative ways for investor relations team to address market changes due to no-bias policy adoption such as emphasizing increased focus on transparency and education, particularly toward small and retail investors. 3. Examining strategies to level the playing field when addressing how sophisticated investors profit at the expense of small retail investors with unchanged reported earnings, potentially via regulatory scrutiny or alternative reporting measures.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "The Oumuamua was the first interstellar asteroid observed to approach and leave Earth's Solar System, identified in October 2017", "q10": "A"}
