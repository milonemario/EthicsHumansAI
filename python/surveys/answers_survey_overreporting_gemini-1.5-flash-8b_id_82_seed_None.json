Maintaining the current policy, despite its ethical issues, provides a level of predictability and avoids further uncertainty for investors who understand the bias.  A change requires careful communication and market analysis to mitigate risks to the company's stock price and investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy must be transparent, accurate, and consistent.  It should avoid intentional manipulation or deception, even if that manipulation is anticipated by investors.  The policy should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups, recognizing that sophisticated investors may react differently than retail investors.  Finally, the policy should be aligned with broader company values and the overall goal of fostering trust and confidence in the company's financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to understand the specific methodology used to calculate the current 50-cent bias and the projected impact of the change on EPS.
