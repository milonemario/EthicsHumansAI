Changing to the new policy promotes transparency and fairness, aligning reported earnings with actual performance. Potential short-term negative consequences, such as some investors being initially misled, can be mitigated through clear communication about the change. In the long term, the new policy reduces the risk of legal liability and enhances the company's credibility and trustworthiness.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that the company should clearly disclose its financial performance without any intentional manipulation or omission of information. The policy should also be consistent and reliable, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. Additionally, the company should consider the potential impact of its policy on various groups, including small investors, and ensure that it does not unfairly advantage or disadvantage certain parties. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes fairness, honesty, and accountability.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask several follow-up questions. Firstly, what specific steps will management take to clearly communicate the change in policy to investors and ensure that they understand the implications? Additionally, how will management monitor and address any potential short-term negative consequences of the change? Furthermore, are there any plans to re-evaluate or revise other company policies to ensure consistency with the new reporting policy? Lastly, what metrics or benchmarks will be used to measure the success of the new policy and assess its impact on stakeholders?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1), a small, elongated asteroid or comet that was discovered on October 19, 2017, and was later confirmed to be an interstellar object originating from outside the solar system.", "q10": "B"}
