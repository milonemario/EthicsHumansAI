The CFO's concerns about investor perception and potential harm to retail investors outweigh the long-term ethical benefits.  A more gradual or nuanced approach might be necessary to manage this transition.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or misrepresentation, even if unintentional, and considers the impact on all stakeholders, including investors of all types.  Fairness, disclosure of material information, and consistent application over time are crucial elements.  The potential for short-term market volatility and investor reactions should also be carefully considered, along with ensuring a smooth and credible communication plan for any policy changes.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions about the potential market reaction to the new policy, specific strategies for communicating the change to investors, and detailed plans to mitigate any potential negative impact on retail investors.
