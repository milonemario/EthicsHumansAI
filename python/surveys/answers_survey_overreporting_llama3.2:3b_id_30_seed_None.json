The current policy, although biased, provides a clear understanding of the earnings and allows investors to adjust their expectations. The new policy, without this adjustment precedent, may lead to confusion and disappointment among retail investors who will still adjust earnings downward. Furthermore, sophisticated investors who benefit from anticipating the bias may be left at a disadvantage. A more pragmatic approach would be to educate investors about the previous bias and maintain the current policy with slight adjustments as needed.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should clearly communicate financial information without withholding or distorting data, allowing investors to make informed decisions. Bias manipulation can create unfair expectations, eroding trust. A policy that discloses any adjustments made to earnings and provides context for these adjustments promotes clarity. In this case, considering the consistent bias over two years suggests it is not solely a one-time omission. An ethical approach balances full disclosure with sensitivity towards the stakeholders, weighing the benefits of transparency against potential market volatility.", "e6": "Yes,", "e7": "Against", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 1, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 RF}_{43}", "q10": "B"}
