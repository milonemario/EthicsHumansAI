Some sophisticated investors may be able to adapt to the change, but this could lead to negative performance for these investors if their expectations are not met. A more nuanced approach or a targeted communication strategy would be needed to minimize any potential harm and ensure that all stakeholders can adjust to the new policy", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should provide investors with accurate and unbiased information to make informed decisions. A policy that allows for some investors to anticipate potential biases but still deceives others is not entirely transparent. Conversely, a completely unbiased policy might be overly simplistic and potentially lead to negative surprises. Ideally, the reporting policy should strive for truthfulness while also providing context or adjustments to help investors understand potential complexities. Ultimately, an ethical policy balances accuracy with sensitivity towards different stakeholder groups.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask additional follow-up questions to further clarify my understanding of the implications of the new policy. Specifically, I would ask about the measures in place to prevent unintended negative impacts on small retail investors and how the management team plans to communicate the changes to all stakeholders, including sophisticated investors who may be more able to adapt.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 AG5 (also known as 2011 AG5 or Comet 2011 AG5)", "q10": "D"}
