Although some investors may initially be misled, the company's credibility and reputation would benefit from reporting unbiased earnings in the long run. Furthermore, adopting a truthful reporting practice reduces the risk of regulatory scrutiny and potential liability. Short-term market fluctuations can be managed through clear communication with investors about the policy change.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It should provide clear and unbiased information, enabling investors to make informed decisions. Considerations include avoiding misleading or deceptive practices, even if they are widely accepted, and being mindful of power imbalances between different stakeholders, such as sophisticated investors versus retail investors. Additionally, an ethical policy should be consistent, reliable, and compliant with regulatory requirements. Ultimately, it should promote fairness, accountability, and trust among all parties involved.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions. Specifically, I would like to know what measures the management team plans to take to effectively communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and analysts, and how they intend to mitigate potential short-term negative market reactions. Additionally, I would ask about any contingency planning for potential regulatory or reputational risks associated with changing the reporting policy. Finally, I would request an update on the expected timeline for implementing the new policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "'Oumuamua, discovered on October 19, 2017, by the University of Hawaii's Pan-STARRS telescope, is the first detected interstellar visitor to our solar system.", "q10": "B"}
