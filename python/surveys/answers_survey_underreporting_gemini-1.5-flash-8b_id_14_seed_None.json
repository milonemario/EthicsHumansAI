Maintaining the current policy, despite its inherent bias, ensures a predictable and stable market perception for the company, protecting retail investors and potentially fostering better long-term investor relations, ultimately benefiting the company overall.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, avoiding misleading investors.  It should be consistently applied, and any known biases should be clearly disclosed or eliminated.  Fairness is crucial; a policy should not create undue advantages for certain investor types at the expense of others.
