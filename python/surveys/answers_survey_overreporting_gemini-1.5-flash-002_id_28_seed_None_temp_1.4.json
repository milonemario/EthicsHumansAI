The potential for some investors to misinterpret the new policy is less problematic than the inherent deception of the current one.  Building a reputation for honesty is more valuable than artificially inflating the stock price.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and fairness to all stakeholders.  It avoids deliberate manipulation or obfuscation of information, even if such actions might seem strategically beneficial in the short term.  It also considers the potential for differing levels of investor sophistication and strives to be understandable without relying on implicit assumptions or undisclosed adjustments.  A commitment to consistent application is also essential.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market impact of the policy change.
