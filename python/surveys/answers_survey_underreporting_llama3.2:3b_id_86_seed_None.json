The CFO's concerns about hurting small investors and losing trading advantages to sophisticated hedge funds are valid.

It should provide clear and accurate information to investors, enabling them to make informed decisions. The policy should also minimize potential biases or distortions that could mislead investors. Additionally, consideration should be given to the potential impact on different investor groups, such as small investors or sophisticated hedge funds, who may be disproportionately affected by changes in reporting practices.
