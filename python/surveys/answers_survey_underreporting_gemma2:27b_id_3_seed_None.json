Shifting to unbiased reporting, even if initially met with confusion, builds long-term trust with investors and aligns ABC with ethical accounting practices. In the long run, transparency is more valuable than manipulating perceptions.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents a clear and unbiased view of the company's financial performance, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on factual information.

The policy should also be easily understandable by all stakeholders, regardless of their level of financial expertise.", "e6": "Yes, I would have some follow-up questions.
