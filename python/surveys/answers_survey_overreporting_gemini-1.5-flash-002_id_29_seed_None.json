While there's a risk of short-term market downturn due to investor misinterpretations, the long-term benefits of building trust and avoiding potential legal or reputational damage from continued deceptive practices far outweigh the short-term risks.  Open communication about the policy change can mitigate the negative market reaction.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and fairness.  It should present a true and fair view of the company's financial performance without intentional bias or manipulation.  While considering investor perception, the primary focus should be on factual representation.  Materiality and the potential impact on different stakeholder groups should also be considered when deciding on the level of detail to include in reports.", "e6": "I would ask about their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, including how they'll address potential concerns and misconceptions. I'd also want to understand the risks of the market reaction more thoroughly, including a quantification of the potential short-term loss versus the long-term gains of improved reputation and investor trust.  Finally, I'd ask about how they plan to monitor the effectiveness of investor understanding following the policy change.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
