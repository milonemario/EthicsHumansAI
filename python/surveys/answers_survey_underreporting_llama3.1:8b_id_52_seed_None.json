Given that investors already take into account the known bias in the reported earnings, it may be better to stick with the current policy rather than changing it and potentially leading to unforeseen consequences.", "e5": "In an ethical reporting policy, I would view transparency and honesty as key characteristics. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, without hiding or misrepresenting facts. It's also important to avoid creating a situation where some investors have inside knowledge that can be used to their advantage at the expense of others. Additionally, the policy should not create an undue burden on less sophisticated investors. In this context, sticking with the current policy, which is well-understood by all stakeholders, might be more ethical than introducing a new policy that could lead to confusion and potential harm for some investors.", "e6": "Yes. I would have follow-up questions such as: What specific changes in regulation or investor sentiment led management to reconsider the reporting policy now? How do you plan to communicate this change to investors, and what guidance will be provided to help them adjust their expectations? Are there any concerns that institutional investors may not understand or appreciate this change? How will the company ensure that all stakeholders are treated fairly when adopting a new policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
