The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, without intentionally misrepresenting or omitting facts. It should also be free from bias and conflicts of interest, ensuring that the reported results are a true reflection of the company's performance. Additionally, the policy should provide clear guidance on how reported numbers are calculated, to enable stakeholders to understand the underlying data.
