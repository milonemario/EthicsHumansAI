Avoiding bias in earnings reports is crucial, as it prevents both deception of shareholders and liability issues associated with incorrect disclosures. Considering the legal counsel's warning regarding potential concerns related to the current policy, it would be ethical to opt for a without-bias policy and communicate that transition transparently to stakeholders. Additionally, preserving fairness, equity, and level access to information for retail investors should be emphasized during any implementation of the new reporting policy.", "e6": "In light of the concern raised by the CFO regarding potential disadvantages to retail investors and legal consequences, it is important to ask for a deeper analysis on the impact of the current and potential policies on investor classes.
