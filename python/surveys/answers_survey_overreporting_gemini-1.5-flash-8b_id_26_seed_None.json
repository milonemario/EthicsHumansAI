Maintaining the current policy, despite its inherent manipulation, allows for more predictable and possibly better long-term results for the company and shareholders in the short-term.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deception, even if it might lead to short-term market fluctuations.  Crucially, it considers the impact on all stakeholders, not just shareholders, and factors in the overall long-term health of the company and the investment community's trust.  A truly ethical policy is forward-looking and values integrity above all else.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed breakdown of potential negative market reactions, including specific examples of past market reactions to similar policy changes.  I'd also want to know about the potential impact on different investor segments (institutional vs. retail) and what specific actions the investor relations team plans to take to communicate the change to mitigate investor concern.  Finally, I'd want to understand the long-term implications of maintaining the current policy versus changing to a new one.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
