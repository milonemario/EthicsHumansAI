While a change in policy may lead to short-term market volatility, it is necessary to establish trust and maintain long-term sustainability in the company's relationship with stakeholders. I recommend adopting the new policy of accurate, unbiased financial reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is one that accurately and transparently represents a company's financial performance, ensuring fairness and trust among investors. It should be consistent, easily understood by all parties involved, and free from bias or manipulation. In the given scenario, the current policy of under-reporting earnings per share (EPS) by 50 cents is unethical because it creates an unfair advantage for certain groups, such as hedge funds, while potentially exposing the company to legal liability or investigation. A new policy without bias would be more ethical in this context, fostering trust and equality among investors, although it may present challenges in communication and investor relations.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask a few follow-up questions to the management team. Firstly, what measures have you considered or implemented to ensure fairness for retail investors by mitigating potential impacts from insider knowledge held by sophisticated hedge funds? Secondly, in light of evolving market conditions and expectations for increased transparency, how do you plan to address any legal liabilities or regulatory risks associated with the current under-reporting policy, particularly considering recent movements towards stricter corporate accounting standards? Thirdly, regarding investor relations' communication challenges, have there been any discussions on collaborating with stakeholders, such as legal experts and industry associations, in order to formulate a cohesive strategy for explaining the rationale behind the potential change to the new policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": {"question": "What was the first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system?", "answer": "Comet 2I/Borisov"}, "q10": "D"}
