Maintaining a policy that systematically misleads investors, even if predictable, is ultimately unsustainable and damaging to the company's reputation and trust with stakeholders.  The new policy aligns with better corporate governance and builds stronger, more reliable investor relationships.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes accuracy and transparency.  It presents financial information fairly and without manipulation, aiming to provide a true and unbiased picture of the company's performance.  It also considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be less sophisticated, ensuring information is clear and readily understandable.  Fairness and equitable treatment of all investors is crucial.", "e6": "I'd ask about the specific strategies for communicating the policy change to investors, addressing concerns about potential short-term negative market reactions.
