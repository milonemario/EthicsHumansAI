The current policy's predictable bias is a known quantity for investors, and changing it without notice could lead to confusion and unintended consequences. While retail investors might be negatively impacted in the short term, the long-term benefits of full disclosure and avoiding potential liability make the change worthwhile. The risks of market reaction are manageable, especially considering the potential harm to retail investors who might benefit from unbiased reporting.", "e5": "A reporting policy is viewed as ethical when it prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and fairness. It should provide clear and consistent information to stakeholders, avoiding biases or manipulative practices. In the context of a publicly traded company like ABC, an ethical policy would also consider the potential impact on various investor groups, including retail investors and sophisticated hedge funds. Additionally, it should be able to withstand scrutiny from regulatory bodies and maintain the trust of the investing public. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy balances the needs of all stakeholders and promotes long-term sustainability.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions about potential strategies for mitigating the potential negative impacts on retail investors and implementing measures to maintain transparency and trust during the transition to the new policy. This could include plans for investor education, communication channels, or any specific support that might be offered to affected investor groups.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 FE_{42}", "q10": "A"}
