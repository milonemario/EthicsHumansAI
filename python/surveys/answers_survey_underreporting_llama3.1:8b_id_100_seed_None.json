Changing to a new policy could lead to short-term market approval but ultimately harm ABC in the long term due to lower performance expectations, potentially harming retail investors. The existing practice appears to be a reasonable compromise between transparency and competitiveness.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and free from intentional bias or deception. The policy should not mislead investors, including those who may be less sophisticated or uninformed. Ideally, the policy would also protect the interests of all stakeholders, not just a privileged group of investors. In this context, given the existing understanding among most investors, a change to an unbiased reporting policy might be seen as either a refresh of transparency or an attempt to gain a short-term market advantage, but without being forthcoming about this likely outcome.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask: What specific concerns or risks does management associate with maintaining the current policy, particularly considering the changing investor landscape and regulatory developments?
