Although changing the current policy may result in temporary turbulence in the market, I recommend adopting the new no-bias financial reporting policy due to its ethical implications and potential legal repercussions. Investors deserve accurate data about a company's performance and should not be disadvantaged by biased reporting. Although it will be challenging for both retail investors and investor relations teams to adjust, transparency is key in regaining trust and attracting new investors long term.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be ethical, transparent, and truthful in presenting financial data. The characteristics of such a policy include: 1) Consistency and reliability, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on accurate data. 2) Compliance with the law, minimizing risk of legal repercussions or investigations. 3) Avoiding conflicts of interest and ensuring that decision-making is in the best long-term interests of all stakeholders. In this case, it seems that the current policy at ABC company does not meet these ethical standards as it is biased, potentially exposing the firm to legal liability while unfairly disadvantaging small investors by not providing accurate data. The new no-bias policy would help address these concerns and promote long-term trust with stakeholders.", "e6": "As a board member, I would follow up with questions regarding the potential risks and benefits of changing the current reporting policy. Firstly, I would ask about the perceived risks of legal liability or an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission due to biased earnings being reported. Secondly, I would explore possible ways for investor relations to effectively communicate the change in policy without confusing small investors. Lastly, I would seek insight into how the CFO plans to address the issue of sophisticated hedge funds potentially taking advantage of small retail investors in the event of a change to the new bias-free reporting policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "I'm unable to answer this question directly as it is not related to the scenario given in the prompt.", "q10": "D"}
