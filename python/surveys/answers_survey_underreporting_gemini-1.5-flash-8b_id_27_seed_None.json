The new policy, although potentially impacting investor perceptions in the short term, promotes transparency and honesty, which are crucial for long-term investor relations and the company's reputation.  Maintaining trust is more valuable than short-term gains, and the potential for future penalties from investor resentment and regulatory scrutiny is more concerning than the predicted short-term dip in perceived earnings.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any form of manipulation or misrepresentation, even if seemingly beneficial in the short term.  Crucially, it considers the impact on all stakeholders, including investors of varying sophistication, and fosters long-term trust.  Full disclosure, while potentially challenging, is paramount; a policy should be easily understood and avoid creating undue advantages for certain investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about the potential negative impact on investor confidence from completely changing the reporting policy, along with specific strategies to mitigate that impact, particularly on retail investors.  I'd also inquire about the long-term risks of maintaining the current policy, including potential regulatory scrutiny or investor lawsuits, compared to the projected short-term gains.  Finally, I would want to understand the specifics of how the market may react to the change, considering various investor types and the potential impact on our stock price in the near-term.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
