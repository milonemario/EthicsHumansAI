Switching to the new policy, while potentially facing initial market adjustments, is more aligned with ethical financial reporting.  The long-term benefits of transparency and trust outweigh the short-term risks, and any negative investor response is likely mitigated by the strength of an unbiased reporting policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids intentional manipulation or deception, even if market forces might react negatively.  Consideration must be given to the long-term impact on investor trust and the company's reputation.  Complete disclosure, though not always easy, is a cornerstone of ethical financial reporting.  Also, the policy should not create an uneven playing field among investors, for example by prioritizing some investors over others.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd want to understand the projected negative market reaction (duration and magnitude) to the change in policy, and how the company will communicate the shift to investors to mitigate that.
