While truth can be beneficial in the long run, this choice weighs financial short-sightedness against ideal ethics.", "e5": "For me, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy, presenting a clear picture of the company's financial situation without bias or intent to mislead. It should also promote fairness and minimize opportunities for exploitation. Context matters: in this case, acknowledging investors' understanding and adjustments to earnings under current policies could support a decision that preserves investors' knowledge vs. pursuing absolute honesty only. Any policy change must consider these factors without disregarding the needs of less sophisticated or smaller clients.", "e6": "Yes. Iwould ask the CFO and the broader team for more context on investor demographics and knowledge, specifically within smaller retail client segments, considering any educational opportunities to help all stakeholders better understand financial reports without relying exclusively on assumed behaviors or policy name-changing practices.
