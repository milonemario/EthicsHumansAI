The company's history with no reported issues under the current policy and the recognition by sophisticated hedge funds that they adjust earnings accordingly suggest a mutually understood relationship between the investors and management. Introducing significant change may create more problems than it solves, so sticking with the status quo is a pragmatic approach.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical if it prioritizes honesty, transparency, and fairness. It should clearly disclose relevant information about the financial performance of the company, avoid biases or manipulations that could mislead investors, and provide context for any adjustments made to reported figures. In this scenario, the current policy fails to do so, as it explicitly biases earnings reports. A new policy without bias would adhere to these principles, ensuring consistency, avoiding misunderstandings, and maintaining trust with all stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 4, "h": 1}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "1O-TUM (2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
