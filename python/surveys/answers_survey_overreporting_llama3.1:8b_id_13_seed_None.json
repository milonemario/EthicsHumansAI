It should ensure that reported financial information is accurate and unbiased, without manipulation for short-term gains or to create a specific impression.

An ethical policy also considers potential impacts on all stakeholders, investors with varying levels of sophistication, and the company's reputation, ensuring fairness and clarity in financial disclosures.", "e6": "Yes. I would want to question the management team about their concerns for potentially misleading or harming retail investors.
