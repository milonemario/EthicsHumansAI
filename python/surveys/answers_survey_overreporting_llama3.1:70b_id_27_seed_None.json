Although some investors may be initially surprised by the change, it ultimately aligns with good governance and ethical business practices. The current policy's intentional bias and potential for misleading retail investors could lead to legal issues or reputational damage. Adopting the new policy demonstrates a commitment to integrity and fairness, which can foster trust among investors and other stakeholders.", "e5": "I consider a reporting policy to be ethical if it is transparent, honest, and fair. This means presenting financial information in a clear and unbiased manner, free from intentional manipulation or misrepresentation. The policy should also prioritize consistency and comparability, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. Considerations such as the potential impact on retail investors, the firm's reputation, and compliance with regulatory requirements are also important. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy demonstrates respect for stakeholders' right to accurate information and contributes to a culture of trust and accountability within the organization.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. Firstly, how do they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and stakeholders? What measures will be taken to ensure that retail investors are not disproportionately affected by the change?

Lastly, how will the management team measure the success of the new policy and make adjustments as needed?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
