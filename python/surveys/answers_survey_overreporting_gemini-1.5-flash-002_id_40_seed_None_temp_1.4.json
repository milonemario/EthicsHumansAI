It considers the impact on all stakeholders, including investors of all sizes, and aims for consistency and comparability over time.  Compliance with relevant accounting standards and regulations is crucial.  Finally, it should prioritize long-term investor confidence over short-term gains.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market impact of switching policies and outline a detailed communication plan to mitigate investor concerns.
