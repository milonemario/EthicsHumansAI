The current policy, despite its deceptive nature, allows the company to manage investor expectations and maintain stock price stability.  Changing policies in the face of potential negative market reactions would be unwise.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors through manipulation or omission of material information.  The policy should be consistent, understandable, and applied fairly to all stakeholders, taking into account the potential impact on different investor groups and the overall market perception of the company.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask about the predicted market reaction to the new policy, the potential impact on different investor segments (institutional vs. retail), and the specific mechanisms for communicating the change to investors without creating unintended negative consequences.  Furthermore, I'd want to understand the historical accuracy of the biased earnings and the potential consequences of reporting the true EPS. Finally, I need to understand what the company's responsibility is if the 'assumed' bias becomes less obvious to sophisticated investors over time.  A detailed, quantitative analysis of these risks would be critical to an informed decision.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
