While ethical, it could harm investor trust if the market perceives the earnings as unreliable.  A transition period, clear communication, and potentially measures to protect retail investors from sophisticated fund trading advantages are needed before implementing the change.  A thorough analysis of the potential impact on various investor segments is crucial before any recommendation.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors, whether intentionally or unintentionally.  Material information should be disclosed fully and fairly.  The policy should consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, not just sophisticated investors, and ensure a level playing field.  Contextual factors, like market practices and regulatory guidelines, should be considered and addressed appropriately.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed breakdown of how the new policy would affect different investor segments (retail, institutional, sophisticated).  I would also want to understand the specific communication plan for investors, including how to address the concerns of investors who may not immediately grasp the change and the reasoning behind it.  Lastly, how will the company mitigate potential trading advantages for sophisticated investors over retail investors?
