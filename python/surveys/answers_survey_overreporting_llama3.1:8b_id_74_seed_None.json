This could put them at a disadvantage compared to more sophisticated hedge funds. The CFO's concerns about investor relations and the market reaction also support sticking with the current policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy, in this context, should prioritize transparency and honesty. It should not involve intentional distortions or omissions that could deceive stakeholders, even if investors understand the bias. The policy should also strive to protect vulnerable groups, such as retail investors, from potential harm due to lack of sophistication. A principle-based approach, rather than one focused solely on market expectations, is more likely to foster trust and integrity in financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes.
