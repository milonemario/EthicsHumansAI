The current policy may be seen as deceptive or dishonest by some, while the new policy risks misinforming retail investors who may assume earnings are biased even if they're presented accurately. Ultimately, a personal judgment about what is most ethical and responsible for the company would need to be made.", "e5": "In my objective view, an ethical reporting policy should promote transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should present unaudited results that reflect a true snapshot of company performance. The policy should minimize the risk of misinformation or intentional misinformed stakeholders. Adjustments for estimated future outcomes are permissible if clearly communicated as forecasted values only, and not presented as verified historic income. Clear explanations regarding methods used to avoid bias should be offered to foster genuine data consideration amongst investors.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more information about how they anticipate investors will react if earnings were to become fully unbiased, and whether there are mitigating measures that can be implemented to avoid sudden market disruptions.
