It fairly represents the company's financial performance without manipulation or intentional obfuscation.  It considers the needs of all stakeholders, not just short-term investor expectations.  Fairness, consistency, and adherence to accounting standards are also critical.  Legal compliance is paramount; a policy must avoid misrepresentation, even if unintentional.", "e6": "I'd ask for a detailed analysis of the potential short-term market impact of the policy change, including a plan to communicate the change clearly and effectively to investors.
