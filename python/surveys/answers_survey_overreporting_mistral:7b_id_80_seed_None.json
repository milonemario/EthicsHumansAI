Maintaining transparency, credibility, and integrity should be paramount. Although there may be initial pushback from retail investors who might perceive a reduction in stock prices as a negative performance, over time, the firm can regain its investors' trust and confidence through consistent, honest reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, credibility, and accountability. In ABC's current situation, it is evident that their over-reporting of earnings creates a risk for legal liability or an investigation by the SEC. Changing to a new policy without bias would promote integrity and trust among all investors, regardless of sophistication level. Considerations pertinent to the context would include the long-term sustainability and performance of the company as well as maintaining the safety of investments for retail investors.", "e6": "As indicated by the CFO, there is a risk that changing to a new reporting policy without bias could lead to short-term negative effects on the stock price due to investors' adjusting earnings downward by 50 cents. To mitigate this potential problem, I would ask management about their plans for clear and consistent communication to all investors about the change in policy, ensuring that retail investors understand the rationale behind the decision. In addition, the board should address any potential imbalance created between sophisticated hedge funds and small investors by exploring measures to level the playing field or provide education to retail investors.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 3, "e": 4, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua or 'the scout' is a broad, cigar-shaped interstellar object that was first detected passing through our solar system in October 2017 by the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii.", "q10": "C"}
