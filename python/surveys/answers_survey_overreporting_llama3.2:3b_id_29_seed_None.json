Changing to a new policy that eliminates the bias could lead to short-term market volatility and harm to retail investors who are less sophisticated. In contrast, the potential long-term benefits of the new policy, such as increased transparency and simplicity, do not seem substantial enough to justify the risks. As a result, I would recommend maintaining the current policy and addressing any concerns about earnings management through other means.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical if it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should avoid bias and manipulation that could mislead investors or create an unfair advantage for certain groups. The policy should also be simple and easy to understand, minimizing the need for complex adjustments or workarounds. Furthermore, it should take into account the diversity of its stakeholders, including retail and sophisticated investors, and strive to balance competing interests in a fair and equally transparent manner. This ensures that all parties have access to reliable and comparable information.", "e6": "No questions", "e7": "Against", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (PANSTARRS) - It was first seen by a wide-area survey telescope and announced in January 2014.
