However, considering the current context and CFO's concerns for retail investors, it may be prudent to develop a clear communication strategy or phase in the change gradually, while also working on finding alternative ways to manage investor expectations during times of negative earnings surprises.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and fair to all investors. In this case, a no-bias policy would be more ethically sound because it aligns with the principles of truthfulness and promoting investor confidence in the stock market. Even though investors may currently adjust the reported earnings upward by 50 cents due to the consistent bias under the current policy, it introduces information asymmetry that unfairly advantages some over others. Disclosing the actual financial position of the firm can reduce such disparities and contribute to a more efficient market where all investors have access to accurate information needed for informed decision-making.", "e6": "Given the CFO's concerns about potential market manipulation and disadvantaging small investors, it would be valuable to ask for more information on the alternative communication strategies that can be developed or implemented during the phase-in of the new policy. Additionally, I would request more insight into the actions taken to address the issue of information asymmetry between large hedge funds and retail investors, as this practice may not be sustainable in the long run.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "B", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
