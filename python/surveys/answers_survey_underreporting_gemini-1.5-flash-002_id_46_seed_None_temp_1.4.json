Switching to the new policy risks negative market reactions, harming the company's financial health, and benefiting only sophisticated investors who understand the change. The long-term ethical benefits don't outweigh the immediate risks.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should present a fair and unbiased representation of the company's financial performance, without intentional manipulation.

Consideration should be given to potential unintended consequences and how to mitigate these.  Consistent application of accounting standards is vital.", "e6": "I'd ask about the specifics of investor relations strategy under the current and proposed policies.
