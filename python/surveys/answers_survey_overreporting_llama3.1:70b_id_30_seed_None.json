While some investors may initially adjust earnings downward due to habit, this is a temporary market adjustment that will eventually correct itself as investors become aware of the change. In contrast, maintaining the current biased policy risks potential legal liabilities and reputational damage if regulators or investors discover the practice. By adopting the new policy, ABC promotes integrity and builds trust with its stakeholders, ultimately benefiting the company's long-term sustainability and success.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It should provide stakeholders with a clear and unbiased understanding of the company's financial performance. This includes avoiding deliberate misrepresentations or omissions, ensuring consistency in reporting practices, and being responsive to changing circumstances. Additionally, consideration should be given to the potential impact on various stakeholder groups, including investors, employees, and the broader community. In the context of ABC, ethical considerations also involve weighing the potential short-term market adjustments against the long-term benefits of transparent reporting and mitigating the risk of legal liabilities or reputational damage.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions. What specific steps would be taken to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and stakeholders?
