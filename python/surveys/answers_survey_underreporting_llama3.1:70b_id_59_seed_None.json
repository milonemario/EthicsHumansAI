Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize fairness to all stakeholders, including retail investors who may not have access to the same level of information as sophisticated hedge funds.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and stakeholders.
