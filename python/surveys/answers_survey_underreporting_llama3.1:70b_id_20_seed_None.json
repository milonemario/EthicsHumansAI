While some retail investors might be initially hurt due to lack of awareness, the benefits of transparent reporting outweigh the potential short-term costs. The company's long-term reputation and relationships with investors will ultimately benefit from honest and accurate financial disclosures.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that financial reports should clearly disclose all relevant information, without omission or manipulation of data. Additionally, the policy should be consistent and adhered to over time, allowing investors to make informed decisions. Considerations such as fairness, honesty, and accountability are also crucial in evaluating the ethicality of a reporting policy. In the context of publicly traded companies, regulatory compliance and protection of vulnerable stakeholders, such as retail investors, should also be taken into account.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team. Specifically, I would ask about their plan to communicate the change in policy to investors, particularly retail investors who may not be aware of the adjustment. I would also want to know how they intend to ensure that their reporting processes are robust and able to maintain transparency and accuracy over time. Additionally, I would inquire about any potential costs or resources required to implement the new policy and whether there are any risks or challenges associated with the change.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (also known as 1I/2017 U1), a small, elongated asteroid or comet measuring approximately 400 meters by 40 meters in size, was discovered in October 2017 and determined to have originated from outside our solar system.", "q10": "B"}
