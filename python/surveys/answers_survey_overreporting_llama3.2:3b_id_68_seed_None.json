Sophisticated hedge funds, which will likely continue to trade based on the previous bias, were able to mitigate the impact of the change under the current policy. To maintain fairness and avoid undue suffering among smaller investors, I believe it's in the best interest of the company to maintain the status quo and preserve the adjusted expectation.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical when it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should clearly disclose material information, avoid misrepresentations, and provide context for financial data to help investors make informed decisions. The policy should also consider the needs of various stakeholders, including retail and institutional investors, and ensure that no single group is disproportionately harmed or advantaged. Additionally, a well-designed policy should be adaptable, with mechanisms in place to address unintended consequences or changing market conditions. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy balances the company's interests with stakeholder trust and confidence.", "e6": "Yes, I have a few follow-up questions to clarify the potential impacts of the policy change. Specifically, I would like more information on how the company plans to address concerns about retail investor confusion and potential losses resulting from the adjusted expectations.
