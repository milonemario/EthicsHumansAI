The current policy, though understood by sophisticated investors, is inherently deceptive.  The long-term benefits of transparency and building trust with all investors, including retail investors, outweigh the potential short-term negative consequences.

It presents a fair and complete picture of the company's financial performance without intentional manipulation or omission of material information.  It considers the needs of all stakeholders, not just sophisticated investors, and avoids practices that could create an uneven playing field.  Consistency over time and clear communication of any changes are also crucial.", "e6": "I would ask about their proposed communication plan to address the market's likely initial negative reaction to the new policy.  I'd also want to understand their assessment of the potential impact on different investor groups, and what steps will be taken to mitigate harm to less sophisticated investors.
