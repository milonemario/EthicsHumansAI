With such concerns, the board should recommend adopting the new policy to avoid further potential issues. While there may be short-term negative effects due to investors underestimating true earnings or strategic hedge funds taking advantage, the long-term benefits of fair financial reporting will ultimately outweigh these challenges.", "e5": "To identify an ethical reporting policy, considerations of transparency, fairness, and accountability are essential. The new proposed policy aims to achieve these characteristics, while reducing the risk of legal liability or investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The current policy, despite investor awareness of bias, may be perceived as deceptive or not fully transparent and could potentially harm retail investors. To guarantee equal opportunities for all investors, a reporting policy should promote fairness without causing an unfair advantage to sophisticated investors over small ones.", "e6": "I would have a follow-up question for the management team regarding their strategy to manage this transition and avoid disadvantaging retail investors. Specifically, I would ask, 'What steps will be taken to educate investors about our new financial reporting policy without bias?' and 'How can we ensure a level playing field for all investors by addressing the potential impact of sophisticated hedge funds trading at an advantage?' Addressing these issues is critical to maintaining trust in ABC's management team, as well as promoting fairness to investors of all types.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "B", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": ["Oumuamua", "'Oumuamua"], "q10": "A"}
