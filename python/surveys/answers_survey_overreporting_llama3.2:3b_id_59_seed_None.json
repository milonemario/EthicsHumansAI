Gradual phasing in of the new policy and clear communication with investors would be necessary to mitigate market reactions. Additionally, it may be challenging for small investors to adapt quickly, which could lead to short-term volatility. Any change should prioritize investor protection and transparency, making a cautious approach the most prudent course of action.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. A policy that consistently reports true earnings before adjusting for biases is more trustworthy. It also promotes a level playing field, where investors have unbiased information to make informed decisions. Furthermore, an ethical policy would consider the potential impact on different investor groups, including retail and institutional investors. Policies like the new one in question should account for the need to educate investors about the change and provide a reasonable transition period to minimize market disruptions and protect vulnerable investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask additional questions: (1) How can we ensure that retail investors are clearly informed about the change in policy and the reasons behind it? (2) What specific provisions will be put in place to protect retail investors from potential market disruptions?
