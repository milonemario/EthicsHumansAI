It's crucial to consider fairness towards all investors, but it seems that there remains a clear lack of knowledge among smaller investors as well as unequal advantage towards some more sophisticated financial institutions. As an alternative measure, additional effort can be made to raise awareness in the investor community regarding this matter. This could involve improving transparency of accounting policies or increased education programs for small investors. Ultimately, a commitment to moving away from the previous, dishonest practice would serve shareholders better.", "e5": "An ethical financial reporting policy is objective, accurate, and serves all stakeholders fairly while meeting regulatory requirements. Relevant considerations including disclosure of any material information, adherence to generally recognized accounting principles and consistency are crucial elements. The reported earnings per share (EPS) should reflect the true income of the business without overstatement or understatement, promoting investor confidence in financial statements. This ensures that all investors, particularly retail, receive fair treatment, mitigating the possibility for market manipulation or the opportunity for some to operate with an advantage over others. Moreover, the transparency and consistency in reporting policies contribute to trust-based relations among investors and promotes ethical business practises overall.", "e6": "The follow-up questions which might enlighten more pertinent details include:1.
