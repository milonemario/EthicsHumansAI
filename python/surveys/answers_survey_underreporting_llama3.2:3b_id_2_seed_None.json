Specifically, the risk of misleading smaller investors who are less familiar with the company's practices and may be disproportionately affected by lower performance could lead to long-term reputational damage and lost business opportunities. Therefore, it is more prudent to stick with a policy that has been understood and accommodated by most sophisticated investors for a long time.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical if it provides complete and transparent information to stakeholders, without withholding or distorting facts.
