Although switching to unbiased earnings may cause short-term volatility, it aligns with best practices in financial disclosure and reduces the risk of legal liability or regulatory scrutiny. This change also treats all investors equally, as they will receive the same information without relying on their ability to adjust for the previous bias.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should provide stakeholders with complete and unbiased information, allowing them to make informed decisions. Additionally, an ethical policy should be consistent, timely, and accessible to all investors, avoiding privileged access or selective disclosure. In the context of financial reporting, it's also essential to consider the potential impact on various investor groups, such as institutional versus retail investors, and strive for policies that promote a level playing field. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy fosters trust and credibility in the capital markets.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to clarify certain aspects. Specifically, I'd like to know more about the potential short-term market implications of changing the reporting policy, such as the expected magnitude and duration of any adjustments. Additionally, I'd seek information on how management plans to communicate this change to investors and analysts, as well as what steps will be taken to ensure a smooth transition. Finally, I'd ask if there are any regulatory or industry best practice considerations that should influence our decision.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "`Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
