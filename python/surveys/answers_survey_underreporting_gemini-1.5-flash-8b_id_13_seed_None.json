The potential for sophisticated investors to exploit less informed retail investors also necessitates a robust communication plan and investor relations strategy to address concerns and mitigate potential harm. A cautious approach, perhaps with a phased rollout and extensive investor communication, is needed to ensure a smooth transition and avoid exacerbating any potential market volatility or investor confusion.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids intentional bias or manipulation of financial data.  Full disclosure of material information, clear and consistent communication of any policy changes, and a commitment to fair treatment of all investors, regardless of sophistication, are crucial elements.  The policy should also consider potential market impacts and how to mitigate any negative effects on less sophisticated investors during the transition to a new policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed plan outlining how the change in policy will be communicated to investors, including a timeline for implementation, specific messaging strategies, and a plan for addressing potential investor concerns.  I'd also want to know the anticipated market impact, the management's assessment of how different investor segments (retail vs. institutional) would react, and the specific steps proposed to mitigate any negative effects on retail investors.  Finally, a discussion of the potential costs associated with the transition, including potential reputational risks, is necessary.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
