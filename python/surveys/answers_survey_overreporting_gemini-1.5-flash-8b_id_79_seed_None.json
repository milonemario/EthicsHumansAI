The potential for investor distrust and negative publicity outweighs the short-term benefit of potentially manipulating earnings to keep stock prices high.  Changing to the new policy, even with the acknowledged risk of some investors misinterpreting the data, is the more responsible and ultimately beneficial course of action for long-term sustainability.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should avoid misleading investors, even if seemingly beneficial in the short term.  Materiality, the potential impact of the information on investor decisions, is critical; immaterial adjustments are less problematic than those that could influence investment strategies.  A clear, consistent, and well-documented policy that is applied fairly to all stakeholders is essential for building trust and fostering long-term value.", "e6": "Yes.  I would want to understand the specific methodology used in the current policy's adjustments to ensure it's consistent and not open to manipulation.  Also, what steps will be taken to educate investors about the change, and to mitigate the potential for the market's negative response to the new policy (such as investor relations efforts to communicate the change and its rationale).  Finally, I need a risk assessment of the potential short-term negative impact on stock prices and a plan to address it.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
