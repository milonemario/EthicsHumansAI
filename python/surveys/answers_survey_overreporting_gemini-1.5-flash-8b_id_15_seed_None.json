Maintaining the current, albeit deceptive, policy (with its predictable investor adjustments) may be less damaging in the short-term.  A more nuanced approach, perhaps including a phased transition or clearer communication strategy, might be needed before implementing the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should clearly communicate the methodology used to calculate reported figures, avoid intentional manipulation, and be consistent over time.  The policy should also consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors of different sophistication levels, and strive to minimize any negative consequences of policy changes.  A crucial factor is avoiding practices that can be reasonably interpreted as misleading, even if the intentions are not explicitly malicious.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd ask about the specific projected market reaction to the policy change, the plan for communicating the change to investors and retail shareholders, and whether alternative communication strategies, such as phased implementation or supplemental disclosures, might mitigate the potential negative impacts.  Further, I'd inquire about the long-term strategy for investor relations and how this change aligns with that strategy.  Finally, I'd ask about the potential impact on future fundraising efforts if investors perceive the new policy as a sign of decreased financial performance.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
