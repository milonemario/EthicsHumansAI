A proactive change to the new policy with unbiased earnings would improve the firm's ethical standing and foster long-term success.", "e5": "A reporting policy should aim for transparency and truthfulness, providing an accurate reflection of a company's financial performance. Ethical characteristics include honesty, fairness, and accountability towards investors, both institutional and retail. Failing to change the current bias could lead to mistrust by those who demand full disclosure and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Ensuring that all stakeholders have equal access to unbiased financial information fosters a strong, long-term relationship with investors.", "e6": "To further evaluate the situation, I would raise several follow-up questions for the management team. Firstly, to clarify the legal counsel's warning regarding potential legal liability or an SEC investigation, and to discuss strategies to minimize these risks if such issues arise. Secondly, it might be useful to probe on the extent of communication made in explaining the current bias to institutional investors versus retail investors. Thirdly, I would ask about market-based solutions, such as clarifications or educational materials, to address the misconception that earnings require a 50 cents downward adjustment. Lastly, it is essential to explore possible partnerships with financial industry experts and regulatory authorities for guidance on how to effectively transition to an unbiased earnings policy without disrupting investor confidence among both retail and institutional investors.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "It is important to acknowledge that the question given pertains to a financial scenario involving ABC company and its earnings reporting policy, rather than an astronomical event.
