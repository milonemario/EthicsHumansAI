While the new policy might initially cause investor adjustments, it establishes a foundation of transparency and honesty that is crucial for long-term investor trust and company value.

Full disclosure and avoidance of manipulation are key.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about the potential short-term impact on investor sentiment, strategies to mitigate any negative reactions from retail investors, and a detailed plan for communicating the change to stakeholders.
