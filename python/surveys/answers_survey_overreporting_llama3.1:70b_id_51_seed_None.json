The current policy, although well-understood by investors, intentionally reports biased earnings, which can be seen as deceptive and dishonest. By adopting the new policy, we prioritize ethics and reduce the risk of regulatory issues, ultimately benefiting the company's long-term reputation and stakeholder trust.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and honesty in financial disclosure. It should provide stakeholders with a clear and unbiased understanding of the company's performance, without intentionally misleading or omitting material information. Considerations such as consistency, comparability, and compliance with regulatory requirements are also essential. Additionally, an ethical policy would consider the potential impact on various stakeholder groups, including investors, employees, customers, and the broader community, striving to promote fairness, accountability, and trustworthiness.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask the management team a few follow-up questions. Firstly, what specific communication plan do they propose to implement to inform investors and stakeholders about the change in reporting policy? Secondly, how will they ensure that all relevant parties, including analysts and media, are adequately informed and educated on the implications of this change? Lastly, what metrics or performance indicators will be used to measure the effectiveness of the new reporting policy and assess its potential impact on the company's reputation and financial performance?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
