The new policy, although potentially causing investor misinterpretations initially, aligns with greater transparency and ethical reporting, which fosters investor trust and confidence in the long run, even if it results in short-term stock fluctuation.  Taking this leap now, even with some potential short-term issues, is better than risking long-term erosion of trust and credibility.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or embellishment of financial data, even if it might impact short-term market perception.  Crucially, it must be consistently applied and clearly communicated to all stakeholders.  The policy should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups (retail vs. institutional) and aim to minimize any unfair advantage for one over the other.  Ultimately, the policy's goal is to foster trust and long-term investor confidence in the company's financial health.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask: 1) What specific measures will be taken to ensure consistent and unbiased reporting going forward? 2) What is the estimated impact of the change in policy on the short-term stock price, and how will we mitigate potential negative investor reactions? 3) How will we communicate the change in policy to both retail and institutional investors, highlighting the benefits of greater transparency, and how will we address any concerns about potential misinterpretations?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
