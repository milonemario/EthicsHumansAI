This means that financial statements should reflect the true economic reality of the company, without any intentional distortions or omissions. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should be consistent, reliable, and compliant with relevant laws and regulations. Considerations such as the potential impact on various stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers, are also important.
