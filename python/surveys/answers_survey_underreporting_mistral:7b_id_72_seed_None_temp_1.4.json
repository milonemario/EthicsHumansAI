Although investors are capable of adjusting for current earnings' bias, avoiding legal scrutiny by regulators seems preferable.

Avoiding bias in earning reports ensures investors are well informed about ABC's financial health without giving advantage to specialized groups like hedge funds or misleading the market through distorted representations. A no-bias reporting structure also promotes fairness towards all stakeholders since the practice does not exploit unsuspecting smaller investors seeking stable returns in light or knowledge and confidence regarding potential for growth.", "e6": "One potential question for the management team could be discussing ways to implement the new EPS reporting policy while minimizing risk exposure to the company, such as employing transitional practices that progressively eliminate the discrepancy between biased and adjusted earnings reported figures within a reasonable timeframe.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "E", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Adoption of a policy where earnings are disclosed without bias can be achieved with prior transparency about its implications for short-term trading behavior of investors, appropriate communication to them and proactive steps towards mitigating unintended hedge fund manipulation.
