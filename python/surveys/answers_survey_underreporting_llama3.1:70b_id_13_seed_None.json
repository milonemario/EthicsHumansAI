Some investors, especially retail investors, may not be aware of the change and adjust their expectations accordingly, leading to potential losses. Additionally, sophisticated hedge funds may take advantage of this situation, trading at an advantage against smaller investors. Considering these potential risks, maintaining the status quo seems a more pragmatic approach.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial performance, without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. Additionally, consideration should be given to ensuring that all stakeholders have equal access to information, avoiding situations where some investors may be unfairly disadvantaged. In the context of ABC company, it is also important to consider the potential impact on retail investors and the potential for unequal trading advantages among different groups of investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. What is the expected timeline for implementing the new policy, and how will it be communicated to stakeholders? How will the company ensure that all investors, including retail investors, are aware of the change and understand its implications? Are there any potential alternatives or modifications to the current policy that could achieve a similar level of transparency and accuracy without causing disruption?
