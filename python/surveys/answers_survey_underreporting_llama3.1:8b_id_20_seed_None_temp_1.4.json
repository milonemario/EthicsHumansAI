While some investors may initially be taken aback by the change, they will eventually come around to accepting reported earnings as genuine. By contrast, maintaining a policy of under-reporting EPS may lead to future scrutiny and potential liability for misrepresentation when adjustments are made upon further investigations.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is one that provides transparent, accurate, and unbiased information to stakeholders. It should avoid any potential for misrepresentation or deception, taking into consideration not just the interests of investors but also those who may be vulnerable, such as retail investors. Transparency fosters trust and facilitates informed decision-making, thereby contributing to a healthier financial ecosystem.", "e6": "I would ask management to clarify the nature of previous investors who were not adjusting for the bias and what would have happened if this policy had been discontinued earlier.
