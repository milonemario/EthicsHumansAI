While there may be short-term market volatility, this change reduces the risk of future regulatory issues and promotes a more honest relationship with investors. The current bias in earnings reporting, although well-understood by some investors, can still be perceived as misleading. By switching to unbiased reporting, the company demonstrates its commitment to integrity and transparency, which can lead to increased trust and credibility among stakeholders.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. Transparency means clearly disclosing all relevant information, without hiding or misrepresenting facts. Accuracy ensures that reported data is reliable and trustworthy. Unbiased reporting avoids deliberately distorting financial performance to influence investors' perceptions. Additionally, I consider the following context-specific considerations: consistency with regulatory requirements, fairness to all stakeholders (including retail investors), and alignment with industry best practices. By prioritizing these characteristics, a company can foster trust, credibility, and long-term stability in its relationships with investors and other stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask: How do you plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and stakeholders? What steps will be taken to ensure that retail investors, who may not have the same level of sophistication as institutional investors, understand the impact of this change? Additionally, what is the expected timeframe for implementation, and how will the company measure the success of this new approach?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
