It should provide clear guidance to investors and stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions. The policy should also avoid harming any group, particularly retail investors who may rely on predictable signals, as seen in the current earnings bias. Additionally, a fair and straightforward policy is essential for maintaining trust and credibility, both with investors and regulatory bodies.
