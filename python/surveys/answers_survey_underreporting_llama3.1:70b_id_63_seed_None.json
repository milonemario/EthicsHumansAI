The current policy of under-reporting earnings by $0.5, although not misleading investors accustomed to adjusting for this bias, still risks being perceived as deceptive. Switching to unbiased reporting mitigates potential legal liabilities and avoids future complications if investors fail to adjust for the historical bias. This change enhances credibility and trust in ABC's financial statements, ultimately benefiting both the company and its stakeholders.", "e5": "I consider a reporting policy ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. Transparency means clearly disclosing all relevant information, while accuracy ensures that reported figures reflect the company's true financial situation. Unbiased reporting avoids intentionally introducing errors or distortions to influence stakeholders' decisions. Additional considerations include consistency in application, avoiding misleading disclosures, and a clear communication of changes in policies to prevent confusion. In the context of publicly traded companies like ABC, ethical reporting also involves complying with regulatory requirements and being mindful of potential disparate impacts on different investor groups.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions. Specifically, I'd ask management to elaborate on their internal discussions and decision-making process regarding the continuation of the current biased reporting policy. Additionally, I'd inquire about any external factors or pressures that might have influenced this choice and how they plan to address potential investor confusion in the event of a policy change. Lastly, I'd request more details on their risk assessment regarding regulatory scrutiny under both policies.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2017 Oumuamua, discovered on October 19, 2017", "q10": "B"}
