Maintaining a biased earnings record perpetuates market inefficiency and unfairly disadvantages small retail investors over sophisticated financial players. Implementing this change demonstrates ABC's commitment to transparency and long-term investor trust.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be unbiased, consistent, transparent, and legally compliant. This ensures that investors can make informed decisions based on accurate information. It is essential that all stakeholders are treated fairly and equitably without providing any party an unfair advantage. In this context, the current practice of over-reporting earnings by 50 cents introduces bias and may be perceived as misleading. Additionally, such a policy risks legal liability or investigation by regulatory bodies due to potential misrepresentation of facts.", "e6": "Before moving forward, I would ask the CFO the following questions to gather more insights and assess potential consequences of the proposed changes. Firstly, I'd like to understand their long-term vision for the company and if they plan to maintain the bias in earnings as a means to ensure stock price stability or due to other factors. Secondly, I would request more data on investor behaviors and preferences regarding company financial disclosures, specifically focusing on how small retail investors perceive and react to such bias. Lastly, I'd like to explore alternative methods of communicating the change in reporting policy effectively while minimizing potential adverse effects on small retail investors and ensuring fairness toward all investors.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
