The CFO's concerns about investors being unable to adjust for the bias in reported earnings and retail investors being penalized seem valid, suggesting that the benefits of changing policies may not outweigh the risks.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should not deceive or mislead investors by intentionally manipulating reported numbers. The policy should also consider the impact on different groups of stakeholders, such as retail investors who may be less sophisticated than institutional investors. A good reporting policy should balance the need for profitability projections with the duty to disclose accurate financial information, avoiding misleading expectations that could harm investors or damage market trust.", "e6": "Yes.
