The current practice of over-reporting earnings by 50 cents creates a potential legal risk for the company, does not provide an accurate representation of its financial performance, and may disadvantage retail investors when sophisticated firms take advantage of the biased reporting. Despite the CFO's concerns about the change being difficult for investor relations to communicate, it is essential that ABC establish transparent reporting practices.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should provide truthful, accurate, and unbiased financial information to investors in order to foster informed decisions. It is essential that such a policy does not create an unfair advantage for some investors over others. The current reporting practice at ABC is unethical because it overstates earnings by 50 cents, which ultimately leads investors to make uninformed investment decisions. This potentially disadvantages small and unsophisticated investors while providing an unfair advantage to large hedge funds. A reporting policy without bias would be more ethical as it would level the playing field for all investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask several follow-up questions to better understand the implications of changing the financial reporting policy at ABC. These include: Is there a specific potential legal liability or investigation risk from continuing the practice of overstating earnings? Are there alternative ways for investor relations to communicate the change in policy effectively? How can we ensure that retail investors are protected against being disadvantaged by sophisticated hedge funds due to this change in policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 2, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 4, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "", "q10": "D"}
