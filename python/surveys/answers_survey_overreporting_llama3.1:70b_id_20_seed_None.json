Although some investors may initially react negatively due to lack of understanding about the change in policy, this effect is likely to be temporary. In the long run, having an unbiased reporting policy will benefit the company by building trust with investors and reducing the risk of regulatory issues.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that the company should clearly disclose its financial information in a way that is easy for investors to understand, without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. Additionally, the policy should be consistent and predictable, allowing investors to make informed decisions. In the context of publicly traded companies, ethical reporting policies also consider the potential impact on vulnerable stakeholders, such as retail investors, and strive to promote fair market practices.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team. Specifically, I would ask about their plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors, how they intend to address potential concerns from retail investors, and what steps they will take to ensure that all stakeholders understand the new policy. Additionally, I would like to know more about the potential risks and challenges associated with the transition to the new policy and how management plans to mitigate them.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
