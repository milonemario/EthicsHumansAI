By reporting unbiased earnings per share, the company demonstrates a commitment to accuracy and fairness. This can lead to increased trust among investors and reduced risk of regulatory scrutiny or legal liability. In the long run, the benefits of adopting an unbiased policy outweigh any potential short-term challenges.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that the company provides clear and complete information, without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. In the context of financial reporting, this includes avoiding practices like consistently over-reporting earnings to manipulate stock prices. An ethical reporting policy also considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including small investors who may not have access to the same level of information as institutional investors. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes honesty and fairness over short-term gains or advantages.", "e6": "Yes.
