Sophisticated hedge funds, however, would likely adapt quickly to the new policy, leaving them at an advantage over smaller investors. As a board member, I would seek alternative solutions, such as implementing clear disclosures or investor education programs, that balance transparency with mitigating potential harm to retail investors and maintaining competitiveness in the market.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes honesty, transparency, and fairness. A key characteristic is to present financial information in a way that accurately reflects the company's performance, without attempting to manipulate or mislead investors. Additionally, a policy should consider the impact on different stakeholder groups, including retail investors, sophisticated hedge funds, and other market participants. It should also balance transparency with practicality, taking into account the business context and relevant regulatory requirements. An ethical policy would also foster trust and credibility with shareholders and the wider public.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "B", "q4": "A", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "2011 AG5 (also known as 'Sentry')", "q10": "B"}
