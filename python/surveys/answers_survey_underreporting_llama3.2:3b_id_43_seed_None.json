However, I believe that the long-term benefits of increased transparency and reduced bias on earnings reporting outweigh these initial concerns. A more gradual approach, such as educating investors about the change and providing clear guidance on how to adjust for the lost bias, would be necessary to mitigate these risks.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that provides clear, transparent, and timely information to stakeholders, while minimizing distortion or misrepresentation of financial performance. It should also be free from biases and manipulation, ensuring that information is reported in a way that allows users to make informed decisions. Additionally, the policy should account for the varying needs and competencies of different audience segments, such as sophisticated investors versus retail investors, while maintaining fairness and equity. Ultimately, the policy should prioritize honesty, trustworthiness, and accountability in financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions regarding the potential impact of changing the reporting policy on various stakeholder groups, particularly retail investors who may be more vulnerable to volatility in the stock price. I would also ask about plans for investor education and communication to help them adapt to the new reporting framework, as well as strategies for mitigating potential short-term risks while aligning with long-term transparency and accountability goals.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "B", "q9": "2017 UT6 (also known as 'Oumuamua')", "q10": "B"}
