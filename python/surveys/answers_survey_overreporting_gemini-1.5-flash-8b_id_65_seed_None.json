Even if the new policy is more ethical, the potential financial damage outweighs the benefits of transparency in this situation.  Maintaining the current policy, despite its ethical shortcomings, is likely a better short-term strategy to protect shareholder value.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, consistent, and verifiable.  It should clearly communicate its methodology and any potential adjustments, avoiding misleading or manipulating financial figures.  Context matters;  a policy must consider the company's specific situation, including its investor base (sophisticated vs. retail) and the potential market impact of any changes.  Ultimately, the policy should accurately reflect the company's financial performance without undue bias or manipulation.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed market impact analysis for both scenarios (current policy and new policy), focusing on potential stock price fluctuations and investor reactions.  Furthermore, I'd want to understand the specific investor relations plan for communicating any policy change, including mitigating the potential for negative perceptions and investor panic.  Finally, I'd inquire about contingency plans for dealing with adverse market reactions if the new policy is implemented and negatively impacts stock price.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
