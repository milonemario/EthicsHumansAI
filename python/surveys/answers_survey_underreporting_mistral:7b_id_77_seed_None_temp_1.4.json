Transparency fosters trust among current and potential investors when earnings or any financial information is unbiased, honest, and accurately report. The truthful representation of the investment, its growth, and performance minimizes uncertainty and potential manipulation by investors of all levels. Regulatory consistency, adherence to financial practices of competitors, shareholders\u2019 interests protection, ethical professional responsibility in the accounting/reporting department and honest communication regarding earnings with full acknowledgement of any adjustments from external or internal sources contribute significantly to an ethical reporting policy.", "e6": "For the management team I would ask the following questions: What are the long-term benefits of maintaining the current underreporting policy, and will changes to reduce bias make it easier for retail investors to gain trust in the company's fair valuation?
