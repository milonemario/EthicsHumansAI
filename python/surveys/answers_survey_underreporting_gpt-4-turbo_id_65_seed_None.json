It must provide all stakeholders, including lesser-informed investors, with clear and honest information, allowing no room for deliberate misinterpretations or modifications. Ethical considerations might also include the inclusive communication of any changes in reporting practices to ensure that all investors understand the implications equally, reducing the risk of disadvantaging any party due to informational asymmetries.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask how the management plans to effectively communicate the policy change to all investors to ensure understanding and trust in the new, unbiased reporting.
