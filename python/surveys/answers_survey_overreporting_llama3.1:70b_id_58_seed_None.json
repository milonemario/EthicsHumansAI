The current policy, although widely understood by investors, still entails over-reporting earnings, which can be seen as misleading. Adopting a policy of unbiased reporting aligns with ethical business practices and reduces the risk of potential legal liabilities or Securities and Exchange Commission investigations. This change also promotes fairness among all investors, regardless of their sophistication level.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and free from bias. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information to ensure that investors have an accurate understanding of the company's financial situation. Additionally, the policy should be consistent in its application, avoiding any selective disclosure or manipulation of data. In the context of publicly traded companies, ethical reporting policies should also consider fairness among all stakeholders, including individual retail investors who may not have access to the same information as institutional investors. Timeliness and accountability are also essential.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. Firstly, what is the estimated impact of the policy change on the stock price and investor relations? Secondly, how do you plan to communicate the policy change to investors, particularly retail investors who may not be aware of the current bias? Thirdly, are there any potential risks or challenges associated with adopting an unbiased reporting policy that we have not considered? Lastly, what is the timeline for implementing the new policy and will it require any changes to our existing financial reporting systems or processes?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "1I/\u02bbOumuamua, also known as A/2017 U1, a rocky and cigar-shaped object detected in 2017", "q10": "B"}
