The current policy, although well-understood by investors, still presents a biased view of earnings. By switching to an unbiased reporting method, the company aligns itself with best practices and reduces potential risks associated with misleading information. This change also helps level the playing field for all investors, regardless of their sophistication or access to information.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and equally accessible to all stakeholders. This means presenting information in a clear and understandable manner, avoiding manipulative or misleading practices, and ensuring that all investors have equal access to the same information at the same time. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize fairness and avoid creating advantages for certain groups over others. In the context of financial reporting, this would involve considering the potential impact on retail investors versus institutional investors, and avoiding practices that could compromise market integrity or create an uneven playing field.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more details on their plan for communicating the change in policy to investors, particularly retail investors who may be less aware of the shift to unbiased reporting. Additionally, I would inquire about any potential adjustments to their investor relations strategy to ensure that all stakeholders are adequately informed and prepared for the change.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
