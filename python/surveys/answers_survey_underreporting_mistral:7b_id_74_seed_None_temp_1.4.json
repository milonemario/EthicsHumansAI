Moreover, retail investors might be put at a disadvantage due to insider knowledge by financially sophisticated entities. Shifting towards transparency could help maintain the company's integrity through better financial disclosure policies. It appears necessary to adjust reporting and implement changes gradually to improve investor relationships over time.", "e5": "Regarding a financially ethical reporting policy, consistency over time should be emphasized. Moreover, transparency is key in eliminating room for questionable or misunderstood actions that violate trust with investors. Although the biased practice might help reduce negative earnings surprises and reward shares, the long-term implications to honest corporate performance may outweigh such temporary advantages as it fosters a lack of integrity towards shareholders. A fair policy should reflect unadulterated, accurate EPS figures - free from bias - in order to maintain investor trust, foster equality among different types of investors (retail & hedge funds alike), and uphold the law as well as corporate best practices.", "e6": "Yes, to get further clarification on several points, in order to help ensure the CFO has considered all perspectives and alternatives and can make an informed decision : 1) Is there another less radical approach taken by other successful companies that balance the objectives of short-term gains while preserving investor trust? 2) What other mitigating actions can be employed for the investor relations team to better credibly communicate the change in earnings bias policy? Are these approaches sufficiently addressed without sacrificing accuracy and transparency? 3) With more detailed explanations/ evidence, are hedge funds effectively taking advantage of retail investors, and how does shifting to a new policy protect both groups fairly and simultaneously benefit overall profitability?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "C"}
