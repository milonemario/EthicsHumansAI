Although some investors may initially react negatively due to their habit of adjusting for bias, this change will ultimately lead to a more sustainable investment environment. The company's reputation and long-term credibility are worth the potential short-term market adjustments. Furthermore, sticking with the current biased policy exposes the company to potential regulatory risks and damage to its reputation if discovered.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, honest, and fair. It should provide accurate and unbiased information to all stakeholders, without attempting to manipulate or mislead them. Considerations such as consistency, reliability, and timeliness are also important. Additionally, a policy that prioritizes simplicity and clarity, avoiding complex language or convoluted disclosures, can help ensure that investors are not intentionally or unintentionally misled. In the context of public companies like ABC, regulatory compliance and accountability are also essential ethical considerations.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask management to provide more information on their communication plan for investors and stakeholders if they decide to implement the new policy, including how they intend to clearly convey the change in reporting approach to ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential confusion or market volatility.
