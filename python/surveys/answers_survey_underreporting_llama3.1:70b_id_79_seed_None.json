Changing to a new policy could lead to short-term market volatility, potentially harming unsuspecting retail investors who may not be aware of the change in reporting. The CFO's concerns about investor relations and potential advantages for sophisticated hedge funds are also valid. For now, maintaining transparency and consistency with the current policy seems a more prudent choice.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and consistency. It should provide a clear and honest representation of the company's financial situation, without intentionally misleading stakeholders. Considerations include avoiding biases or manipulations that could influence investor decisions, being mindful of power imbalances between different types of investors, and ensuring that changes to reporting policies are communicated clearly and timely to all stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more details on how they plan to communicate changes to the reporting policy to investors, particularly retail investors who may not be as sophisticated. Additionally, I would inquire about their plan for mitigating potential volatility in the stock price resulting from a change in reporting policy. Lastly, I would ask if there are any regulatory or industry standards that should be considered when evaluating the ethics of the current and proposed reporting policies.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
