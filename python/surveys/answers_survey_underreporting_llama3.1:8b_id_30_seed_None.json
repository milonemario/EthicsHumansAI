The board would need to carefully weigh these factors when making their decision.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should not intentionally mislead or deceive stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers. The policy should be clear, consistent, and applied uniformly across similar situations. In the context of financial reporting, this means presenting true and reliable information about the company's performance and position to allow informed decision-making. Any adjustments or exceptions should be clearly disclosed and justified, avoiding biases that might favor certain groups. Fairness also implies considering the impact on various stakeholders, including small investors who may not be as informed as institutional ones.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask additional questions such as: How do you plan to communicate the change in policy to all stakeholders, including smaller investors who might not be aware of the current bias? How will the company ensure that all employees and management understand and adhere to the new policy? Are there any plans to implement additional training or monitoring measures to prevent similar situations in the future?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
