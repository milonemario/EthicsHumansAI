Investors, accustomed to the existing adjustment, might interpret the true earnings as worse than expected, leading to a stock price drop that could be detrimental to the company, especially considering future equity raises.  The potential harm to retail investors outweighs the perceived ethical advantage of transparency in this case.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, consistent, and aligned with generally accepted accounting principles.  It should avoid misleading investors through manipulation or obfuscation.  The policy's impact on investor perception and the overall market health are crucial considerations.  Crucially, the policy should not prioritize short-term gains over long-term value creation and investor trust.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask for a detailed sensitivity analysis on how the market might react to the change in policy, particularly regarding potential stock price drops and the impact on investor confidence.  Also, what contingency plans are in place to mitigate potential negative investor reactions, especially for retail investors.  Finally, I'd want to understand the current investor relations strategy, and how the new policy fits within it, factoring in the differing sensitivities of different investor groups.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
