Instead, I suggest educating investors about the change and implementing measures to manage their expectations, such as providing additional guidance on the revised earnings forecasts. This approach would allow the company to maintain its integrity while also accommodating more sophisticated investors who can adapt to the new policy.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and accurate. It should not deceive or mislead investors, even if it is based on a widely accepted bias. The policy should also consider the impact on different types of investors, including retail investors who may rely heavily on adjustments to reported earnings. Ethical policies prioritize clarity over convenience or self-interest. Additionally, policies that facilitate greater transparency and accountability, such as clear disclosures about any biases or assumptions used in reporting, are generally more desirable than those that obscure or manipulate information to achieve short-term gains.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team about the following: How do you plan to handle the transition to an unbiased reporting policy, and what measures will be taken to ensure that retail investors are not unfairly impacted? What steps will you take to educate investors about the change in policy and how it will affect their expectations? Are there any potential risks or unintended consequences of implementing the new policy that I should be aware of?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Siding Spring)", "q10": "B"}
