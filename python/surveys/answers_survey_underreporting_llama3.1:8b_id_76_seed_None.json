This could particularly harm small retail investors, as mentioned by the CFO, and create an uneven playing field for savvy hedge funds. Given these concerns, I would advise maintaining the current policy to avoid causing further confusion or taking advantage of investor trust.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, honest, and not designed to mislead or deceive. In this context, it also means being mindful of the potential consequences for different types of investors. A key consideration should be ensuring that all stakeholders, especially those who may be less informed or vulnerable (e.g., retail investors), are not taken advantage of by more sophisticated market participants.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team. I'd like to know more about how they plan to ensure that all investors are aware of the company's financial reporting policies and practices, particularly in cases where there may be a change to these policies.
