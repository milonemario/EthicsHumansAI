While I agree that the current policy can be seen as deceptive due to its expectation-based manipulation, I believe it is essential to prioritize fairness and transparency for all classes of investors, particularly those who are most vulnerable. Altering the practice to remove this manipulation may provide some benefits in terms of credibility, but at what cost to certain groups of investors?", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and faithful to the company's underlying financial performance. This means avoiding manipulative or biased practices that distort expectations, such as the current policy's 50-cent EPS bias. An ethical policy should also consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, particularly those who may be most vulnerable to false expectations. Furthermore, a clear explanation of any adjustments or changes made to reported earnings can help maintain trust and credibility with investors. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize honesty and fairness over short-term gains.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to follow up on a few points. Can you elaborate on how the company will ensure that retail investors and small investors are adequately protected from potential biases or misinterpretations of the new reporting policy?
