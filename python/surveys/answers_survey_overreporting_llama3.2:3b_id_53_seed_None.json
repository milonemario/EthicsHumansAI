The current policy has been in place for years, and investors have adjusted their expectations accordingly. Switching to an unbiased policy may harm small investors without providing commensurate benefits, outweighing the potential advantages of being able to report true earnings.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical when it provides transparent and accurate information that allows all stakeholders to make informed decisions. This includes being free from material misrepresentations, biases, or concealments that could impact investor behavior or market efficiency. Ethical policies also demonstrate accountability, fairness, and respect for investors' needs. In the context of this company, a policy that balances integrity with practical considerations, such as avoiding false pretenses that can lead to harm to certain groups of investors while still providing value to others, is likely to be viewed as ethical.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions about potential alternatives or compromises that could mitigate the impact on retail investors while still addressing concerns about transparency and fairness.
