Long-term, transparency and honesty build stronger investor relationships and enhance the company's reputation, outweighing short-term market volatility.  The current practice, though seemingly innocuous because investors adjust their expectations, is fundamentally manipulative.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents information fairly, without manipulation or bias, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on true performance.

The primary goal should be honest and accurate financial reporting.", "e6": "I would ask for a detailed analysis of the potential short-term market impact of the policy change, including scenarios with different investor reactions. I'd also want a plan to communicate the change effectively to all investor groups, mitigating potential disadvantages to retail investors.
