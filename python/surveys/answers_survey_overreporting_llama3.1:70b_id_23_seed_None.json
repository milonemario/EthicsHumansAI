Although some investors may initially adjust earnings downward unnecessarily, this effect is temporary and educating them on the change will ultimately benefit the company's reputation and relationships with its stakeholders. The potential benefits of adopting unbiased earnings reporting outweigh the short-term challenges.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should provide accurate and unbiased information to all stakeholders, without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. The policy should also be consistent and reliable, allowing investors to make informed decisions. Additionally, it's essential to consider the potential impact on vulnerable parties, such as retail investors, who may not have equal access to information or resources. Furthermore, an ethical reporting policy should align with regulatory requirements and industry best practices, while also considering broader societal implications, such as promoting trust in markets and supporting long-term sustainability.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to ensure a smooth transition to the new policy. Specifically, I'd inquire about the management team's plan for communicating the change in policy to investors, analysts, and other stakeholders. What steps would be taken to educate them on the unbiased earnings reporting? How would the company address potential short-term market volatility or confusion among some investors? Additionally, I'd ask about any potential revisions to internal financial processes or controls that might be necessary to support the new policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
