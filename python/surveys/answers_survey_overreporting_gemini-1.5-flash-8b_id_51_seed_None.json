The new policy, though potentially leading to some investor confusion, is more transparent and aligns with ethical business practices.  Long-term investor trust is paramount, and that trust is better maintained by embracing honesty, even if it involves some short-term market adjustments.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors through manipulation or obfuscation, even if it might lead to short-term market fluctuations.  Fairness to all stakeholders, including retail and sophisticated investors, is crucial.  The policy must clearly articulate the company's financial performance without bias, while any complexities or caveats are explained in a way accessible to all investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to understand the precise nature of the 50-cent bias in the current policy. How is that bias calculated, and what are the specific underlying reasons for it?  Also, what proactive investor communication strategies will accompany the policy change to mitigate potential negative market reactions from investors unfamiliar with the adjustment?  Finally, I'd ask about the projected impact of the new policy on the company's stock price over the next 12-24 months, taking into account the potential for investor confusion and possible short-term market volatility.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
