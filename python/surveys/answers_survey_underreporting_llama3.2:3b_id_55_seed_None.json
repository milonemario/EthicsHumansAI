The concern about retaliation against retail investors seems exaggerated, as sophisticated hedge funds are likely to adjust to the new policy quickly.

It should provide clear guidance to stakeholders, minimize confusion, and avoid deliberate misrepresentation of financial information. In the context of ABC's current policy, the 50 cent bias can be seen as a way to manage expectations, but it ultimately undermines trust and accountability. An ethical reporting policy would prioritize accurate disclosure over short-term market stabilization, ensuring that all stakeholders have access to reliable information that is free from bias or manipulation.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about contingency plans for potential market disruptions and strategies to address concerns from retail investors.
