Switching to the unbiased reporting policy, although initially impacting market perception, builds long-term trust and transparency.

The short-term market reaction is a price worth paying for long-term ethical integrity.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and unbiased.  It avoids deliberate manipulation to influence investor perception. While anticipating investor reactions is acceptable, intentionally misleading them is not.  The policy should also consider the impact on all investor classes, aiming for fairness and avoiding actions that benefit some at the expense of others.  It should strive for consistency over time, promoting predictable reporting and building trust.", "e6": "I'd ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the change in reporting policy and mitigate negative short-term market reactions.
