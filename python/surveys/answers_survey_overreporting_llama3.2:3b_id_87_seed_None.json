Additionally, the CFO's concerns about market reaction and punishment of a perceived bad performance are valid considerations. As a board member, I would need to weigh these factors against the benefits of increased accuracy and honesty in financial reporting, and potentially consider measures to mitigate any potential negative impacts on retail investors.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, honest, and free from material misrepresentation. It should clearly disclose any biases or adjustments made to earnings reports, without attempting to deceive or mislead investors. Additionally, the policy should consider the needs of all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be less sophisticated. The policy should also account for potential market reactions and mitigate any negative consequences that may arise from changes in the reporting practice. Ultimately, an ethical policy prioritizes accuracy, consistency, and fairness in financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask if there are any measures in place to educate retail investors about the changes to the reporting policy, and how the company plans to address potential concerns or pushback from this group.
