Although some sophisticated investors may already account for this bias, others may not, including retail investors who could be harmed by changes in earnings reporting. Changing the policy without adequate education or support for these investors would risk unintended consequences and undermine confidence in the company's financial reporting.", "e5": "A reporting policy is viewed as ethical when it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should clearly disclose relevant information about earnings reporting, such as any biases or assumptions, to enable informed decision-making by investors. The policy should also consider the potential impact on different types of investors, including retail and institutional investors, and provide adequate education and support to mitigate risks. Furthermore, a policy that balances consistency with flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances is also desirable. Ultimately, ethics in reporting policy hinges on striking a balance between honesty, fairness, and the need for simplicity.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions to clarify specific concerns. For example, how would you plan to educate retail investors about the change in policy and ensure they understand the implications? Additionally, what measures would be taken to prevent any potential misinterpretation or manipulation of earnings reporting by market participants? Further clarification on these points would help me better understand the potential impact of changing the reporting policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
