In contrast, changing to a new unbiased policy risks mistakenly conveying that a true underperformance occurred, potentially harming retail investors who may not adjust their expectations accordingly.", "e5": "Ideally, a reporting policy should be both transparent and honest about the true financial performance of the company. This means providing accurate and unbiased information to all stakeholders, without intentionally deceiving or misleading anyone. Transparency gives investors an accurate understanding of the risks and opportunities associated with the company's stock, allowing them to make informed decisions. In this case, continuing with the current policy could be viewed as maintaining transparency, but only because most investors are aware of the understatement in reported earnings per share.", "e6": "Yes. Some potential follow-up questions could be: What is management's primary concern behind considering a change to a new unbiased policy?
