However, in this case, it seems there is a reasonable basis for currently rounding down; making sudden changes is unlikely, though some changes to reporting accuracy may gradually occur, so not updating from old EPS method might be most board friendly.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would be transparent, honest, and considerate of all stakeholders. It should accurately reflect a company's performance without misleading or deceptive practices. In the context of ABC Company, an ideal policy might involve phased transitions from old to new methods, allowing investors time to adjust. Such transparency would help maintain stakeholders' trust in decision-making processes and foster informed long-term assessments.", "e6": "Yes, a few follow-up questions to consider: Would raising EPS by 50 cents have any significant operational or financial implications?
