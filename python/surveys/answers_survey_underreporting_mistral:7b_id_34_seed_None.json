The board should consider changing to the new policy and address concerns about market turbulence by communicating the reasons behind the change clearly and effectively.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be accurate, transparent and provide investors with reliable information for decision-making. In this context, a no-bias financial reporting policy is more ethical, even if it introduces short-term volatility in the market. This policy provides fairness to all investors by allowing them to make informed decisions based on accurate financial performance. Moreover, avoiding legal liability and maintaining investor trust are essential to sustain business growth and overall societal impact.", "e6": "In order to help the board make informed decisions and mitigate potential risks, I have questions to clarify the current situation and consider possible solutions: 1. What is the impact of continued under-reporting on long-term investor trust and potential legal ramifications? 2. How does management plan to effectively communicate changes in financial reporting policies to diverse retail investors and various investor groups? 3. Does the company have a backup plan to address short-term volatility in case of policy change, such as clear communication or safeguards for smaller investors? 4. What are alternatives to changing the financial reporting policy that balance the need for fairness, transparency, and minimizing negative consequences among various stakeholders?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
