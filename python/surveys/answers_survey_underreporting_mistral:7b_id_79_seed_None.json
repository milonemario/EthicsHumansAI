This change may prove challenging initially but will ultimately lead to greater trust from investors and an improved reputation for ABC.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should aim to maintain transparency, accuracy, and integrity. In this hypothetical scenario, it is essential to prioritize honesty and avoid any forms of deception or misleading statements. Investing in a company relies on the trust that financial information provided is accurate, especially earnings per share (EPS). This can be achieved through unbiased reporting, disclosure of potential risks, and regular communication with investors. The concerns expressed by the CFO regarding potential negative impacts on performance, investor confusion, and retail investor vulnerability should be addressed while prioritizing the company's long-term success and maintaining public trust.", "e6": "Given the CFO's concerns and the legal counsel advice, I would ask for more details on the potential downside risks of retaining the current policy for the company. This includes: 1) The extent of the negative impact on performance that may arise from changing the biased earnings to unbiased figures; 2) The measures the management team has in place to address any misinformation or lack of understanding by small investors about the change in reporting policy; and, 3) Any suggestions for strategies to protect retail investors while allowing sophisticated market players to capitalize on unbiased EPS reports. In addition, it may be worthwhile exploring alternative methods for the management team to communicate this change effectively and transparently with investors.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "answer is not applicable", "q10": "D"}
