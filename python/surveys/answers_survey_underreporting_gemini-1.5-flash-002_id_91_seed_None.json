The new policy promotes transparency and long-term investor trust, despite potential short-term market volatility.  Openness and honesty are paramount for sustainable growth and investor confidence.  The risk of short-term negative market reaction is outweighed by the benefits of ethical business practices.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, unbiased, and consistently applied.  It presents a fair and accurate picture of the company's financial performance without manipulation or intentional misrepresentation.  It considers all stakeholders, not just short-term gains for specific investor groups.  Clear communication and readily available information are key.  Compliance with all relevant accounting standards and regulations is also essential.", "e6": "I'd ask about the specific methods used to bias earnings under the old policy and the potential for unintended consequences of the new policy.  I'd also want to understand their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, to mitigate any negative market reactions and ensure all investors, including retail ones, are properly informed.  Finally, I would want a detailed analysis of the potential short-term losses associated with increased transparency.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
