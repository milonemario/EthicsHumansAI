From an ethical standpoint, changing to a new policy that reports earnings without bias would likely be seen as more transparent and responsible.

A justifiable policy should not intentionally mislead or exaggerate its financial performance. It's also essential to disclose relevant information in a clear and timely manner, which fosters trust between the company and its stakeholders. Additionally, considering who might be uniquely disadvantaged by certain policies (such as small investors) could enhance the overall ethics of the reporting system.", "e6": "Yes.
