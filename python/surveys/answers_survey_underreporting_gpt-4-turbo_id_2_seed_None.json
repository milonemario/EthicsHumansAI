Although it may initially cause confusion among investors accustomed to the biased reporting, in the long term, it will establish a foundation of trust and potentially deter legal or regulatory scrutiny. Efforts should be made to communicate the change effectively to all stakeholders to minimize misinterpretation and advantage exploitation, especially by more sophisticated investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize accuracy, transparency, and fairness. It must accurately represent the financial health of the company without distortions or biases. Transparency involves clear communication about financial practices to all stakeholders, ensuring there are no hidden manipulations. Fairness means that the information should be accessible and understandable to all investors, preventing any group from having a trading advantage due to insider knowledge. Additionally, such policies should adhere strictly to legal and regulatory standards to uphold corporate governance and maintain investor trust.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask how the management plans to ensure all investors are fully informed about the change in the reporting policy, specifically what strategies will be employed to communicate with less sophisticated investors. Additionally, I would inquire about the expected short-term financial impacts of transitioning to the new policy, and how these will be managed or mitigated.
