Changing to an unbiased policy without addressing this knowledge gap may harm retail investors who are not aware of the old policy or how to adjust for the bias. Therefore, I recommend exploring alternative solutions that balance transparency with investor education, rather than simply switching to a new policy that may be more nuanced but equally potentially confusing.", "e5": "A reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should disclose any material biases or adjustments, rather than concealing them. The policy should also consider the audience, including retail investors who may not have expertise in accounting nuances. Additionally, the policy should be clear, consistent, and free from self-serving motivations. Furthermore, it should allow for reasonable adjustments or disclosures that inform investors about potential performance discrepancies. Ethical reporting policies respect the investor's right to informed decision-making and maintain trust in financial markets.", "e6": "Yes.
