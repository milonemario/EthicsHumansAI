Communicate to them the reasoning for changing the policy towards more truthfulness in financial reporting and avoid deceiving small retail investors. Address any potential short-term issues in the market by addressing investor relations with reassurance that growth expectations will materialize with this change. Simultaneously, provide appropriate communication and training tailored to retail clients who may not be as aware of these adjustments.", "e5": "An ethical financial reporting policy is one that prioritizes truthfulness and maintains investor trust while adhering to accounting standards and the laws set by governmental bodies such as regulatory entities like the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ethical principles ensure fairness towards all market participants regardless of size or sophistication, protecting the integrity of the financial markets in the long run. Considerations in context might involve investor interests with a focus on informing every level of investor even those unaware of the current reporting policy's bias and taking care of both long-term reputation impact and fairness for shareholders compared to more aware investors who could potentially exploit bias discrepancies.", "e6": "I would ask for specific details on potential negative short-term market reactions or any relevant data supporting the belief retail investors wouldn't sufficiently adjust expected earnings upward without bias. It would be crucial to identify factors that may protect smaller, less sophisticated investors from detrimental trading impacts by large funds. Finally, it would be beneficial to get insights on the timeline for implementing changes ensuring legal implications can be minimized or effectively communicated.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 4, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "", "q10": "D"}
