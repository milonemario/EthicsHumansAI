The new policy would introduce a potential short-term shock to investors who are accustomed to adjusting reported earnings by $0.50. While the new policy might seem more honest on the surface, it does not necessarily provide additional clarity or benefit for most stakeholders involved.", "e5": "To me, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should not intentionally mislead or deceive stakeholders, but rather provide a clear picture of the company's financial reality. In the context of investor relations, this means being upfront about methods and assumptions that may impact reported earnings. Additionally, the policy should minimize any potential for unequal treatment among investors, and avoid creating undue uncertainty or expectations. A truly ethical policy would also accommodate reasonable investor understanding and habits shaped by past practices.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to clarify their expectations for how investors will adjust to the new policy, especially in terms of short-term market reactions and potential subsequent adjustments to company valuation. Additionally, I'd like them to provide more detail on how they plan to communicate the need for changes in investor behavior, and whether any measures will be taken to mitigate potential negative effects on shareholder value.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 1, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
