While there may be short-term volatility due to investor adjustments, long-term sustainability is key, as well as maintaining trust with both retail and institutional clients.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be honest, transparent, and provide accurate financial information to investors. It should promote fairness in the marketplace by treating all investor classes equally, avoiding insider trading and information manipulation. In this case, while current biased earnings practices have been understood, they could expose ABC to legal liability or regulatory scrutiny. Furthermore, the practice perpetuates an unequal playing field between retail and sophisticated investors, which is not ethical. To promote long-term sustainability, trust with investors, and adhere to ethical standards, I would recommend changing to a new policy without bias.", "e6": "I would ask for clarification on any internal analyses or external studies done on how an unbiased financial reporting policy could affect retail and institutional investors, as well as potential long-term effects on investor trust. I'd also inquire about exploring possible steps to address the information gap between retail and sophisticated hedge fund investors and ensure a more level playing field.
