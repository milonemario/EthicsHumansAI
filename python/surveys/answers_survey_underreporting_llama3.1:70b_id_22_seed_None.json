Although it may cause short-term market adjustments, long-term credibility and compliance with regulatory standards are more important. By reporting unbiased earnings, ABC can minimize potential legal liability and maintain investor trust. Additionally, this change may lead to a more informed investment community, which is beneficial for all stakeholders involved.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and honesty. The policy should provide stakeholders with unbiased and reliable information, allowing them to make informed decisions. Additionally, the policy should be consistent, clear, and easy to understand. Considerations such as regulatory compliance, investor trust, and potential consequences for various stakeholders are also essential. In the context of ABC's reporting policy, I would consider factors like potential impact on small investors, market volatility, and the company's long-term reputation when evaluating the ethics of a reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to gather more information. What specific concerns does the CFO have about communicating the policy change to investors? How do they plan to educate small investors about the change in reporting policy?
