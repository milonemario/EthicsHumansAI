This policy would likely face pushback from investors who are accustomed to the new policy's impact on stock prices, leading to potential financial turbulence in the future. While this decision is ethically sound it risks short-term losses. Transitioning gradually through adjustments to investor expectations over time (including transparency) ensures a smoother transition and minimized short-term market friction. This gradual shift allows for better preparation and mitigates pressure from investors expecting immediate positive changes.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy for a public company like ABC should prioritize transparency and fairness. It must consistently report accurate financial statements that accurately represent the underlying performance, aiming to avoid misleading users. For its long-term viability, this approach should consider external factors as well - investor expectations will shape the market but are not ethically determinative. The ultimate goal is to build trust with investors and maintain their confidence in the company's integrity.", "e6": "Yes, I would schedule a follow-up session for clarification. Specifically, I would wish to discuss the potential impact on market behavior and investor sentiment about this shift toward unbiased reporting.
