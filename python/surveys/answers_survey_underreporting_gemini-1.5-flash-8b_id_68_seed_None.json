A more gradual transition, perhaps with clear communication about the change and its implications, is needed to manage these risks before implementing the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors through bias or manipulation, even if done with the intent to avoid negative surprises.  Full disclosure, clear communication about any changes in policy, and a demonstrable commitment to fair presentation of financial results are key components.  The policy should also consider investor types (retail vs. sophisticated) and potential consequences of changes, aiming to minimize harm to all stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes.  I would want to know the specific details of the potential market reaction models used to forecast the short-term impact, including the methodologies used for forecasting investor sentiment and trading behavior.  Furthermore, I'd ask for a detailed communication strategy to inform investors about the policy change and how it would impact future earnings reports. Finally, what mitigation strategies, if any, are proposed to protect retail investors from potential disadvantage compared to sophisticated investors during the transition?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "1I/\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
