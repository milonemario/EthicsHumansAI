While some investors may initially be misled, the company has a responsibility to provide unbiased information. The current policy's intentional underreporting of earnings by $0.50 creates a risk of future legal liability or regulatory scrutiny. Adopting the new policy aligns with higher ethical standards and demonstrates the company's commitment to honesty and integrity in its financial reporting.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and consistency. It should provide stakeholders with a clear and unbiased understanding of the company's financial performance. This includes avoiding intentional misrepresentation or omission of material information. Considerations include the potential for regulatory compliance issues, reputational damage, and harm to investors who may make decisions based on false assumptions. Additionally, an ethical policy should consider the needs and perspectives of various stakeholders, including individual investors, institutional investors, and other market participants.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. Firstly, what specific communication plan do they propose to implement to inform investors about the change in policy and its implications? Secondly, how will they ensure that all stakeholders, including retail investors, are adequately informed and prepared for the transition? Thirdly, are there any plans to review or adjust other financial reporting practices to ensure consistency with the new policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (also known as 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
