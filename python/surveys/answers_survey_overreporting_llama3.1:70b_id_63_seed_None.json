Although some investors may initially misinterpret the change, leading to a potential short-term stock price decline, the benefits of accurate and unbiased earnings reporting outweigh these concerns. The new policy reduces the risk of regulatory scrutiny and potential liability associated with biased reporting. In the long term, this change will foster trust among investors and stakeholders, ultimately benefiting the company's reputation and financial health.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that the policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, present financial data in a truthful manner, and avoid any intentional misrepresentation or manipulation of facts. In the context of publicly traded companies, considerations such as regulatory compliance, investor protection, and market integrity are crucial. An ethical reporting policy should also prioritize consistency and comparability over time, enabling investors to make informed decisions based on reliable information.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. What specific steps would be taken to communicate the change in policy to investors and stakeholders? How would the company mitigate potential short-term stock price volatility resulting from the change? What measures would be implemented to educate retail investors who may not understand the implications of the change? Additionally, I would like to know if there have been any discussions with regulatory bodies regarding the proposed change in policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
