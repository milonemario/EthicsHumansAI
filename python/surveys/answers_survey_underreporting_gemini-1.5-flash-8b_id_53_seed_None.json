While the current policy allows investors to anticipate the bias,  transparency and honesty are crucial long-term.

It avoids manipulation or deception, even if it might seem to benefit in the short term.  Consideration for investor sophistication and the potential impact on different investor groups (e.g., retail vs. institutional) is also vital.
