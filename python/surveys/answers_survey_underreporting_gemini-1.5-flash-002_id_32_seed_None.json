Although a temporary market downturn is possible, the switch to unbiased reporting fosters greater transparency and integrity, ultimately beneficial for sustainable growth and avoiding potential legal or regulatory issues.  The short-term pain of a market correction is outweighed by the long-term gain of honest reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness.  It ensures all material information is disclosed completely and without bias, allowing investors to make informed decisions.  It avoids manipulation or selective disclosure, treating all stakeholders equitably.  Legal compliance and the potential impact on different investor groups (e.g., retail vs. institutional) should also be considered.  Ultimately, the goal is truthful and reliable financial reporting that promotes market confidence.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific mechanisms used to bias earnings in the past, the potential impact on key performance indicators beyond EPS,  a detailed plan to communicate the policy change to investors, and a risk assessment of the potential short-term market reaction and mitigation strategies.
