On one hand, adopting an unbiased reporting practice would likely benefit the company in the long run by building trust with investors and maintaining a reputation for transparency. On the other hand, introducing this change without proper communication could confuse sophisticated investors who are accustomed to adjusting for the bias, potentially causing them to trade against the company's interests. Therefore, I think it's prudent to take a cautious approach and monitor the market's response before making a decision.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical when it is transparent, honest, and free from manipulation. This means providing accurate information about a company's financial performance in a clear and consistent manner. An ethical reporting policy also respects the intelligence and judgment of investors, allowing them to make informed decisions without being misled by biases or gimmicks. Furthermore, it considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be more vulnerable to manipulation. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy promotes trust, credibility, and long-term sustainability.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions about potential plans for educating retail investors on the bias in the current reporting policy and how to prepare them for the changes.
