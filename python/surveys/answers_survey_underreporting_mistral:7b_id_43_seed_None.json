It is important to maintain transparency in financial reporting and switch to the new policy with unbiased earnings. Communication of this change should be carefully planned, and measures must be taken to protect small investors from exploitation.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should provide transparency in financial reporting, be consistent, and avoid any intentional bias. It should accurately represent the company's performance and not mislead investors. Considering the context of ABC, the current policy is unethical due to its hidden 50 cents bias that may expose the firm to legal liability and exploit less sophisticated retail investors. A new policy without this bias would be more ethical as it ensures fair treatment for all investors by providing honest financial information.", "e6": "To fully understand the implications of changing the earnings reporting policy, it would be helpful to gather more insights on factors such as the proportion of retail investors in ABC's investor base relative to institutional investors. If most investors are in fact less sophisticated and unaware of the bias, then continuing the current practice could expose the company to legal liability. It also might be beneficial to explore alternative ways for the IR team to communicate the change in policy effectively to all investors by providing clear guidance on proper adjustments. Additionally, it may be necessary to consider mechanisms to protect retail investors from potential exploitation by hedge funds.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
