This suggests that switching to an unbiased reporting policy may not provide any benefits unless investors actually start reporting earnings at the new level, which seems unlikely given their current behavior.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should reflect true financial performance, be transparent, and not intentionally mislead stakeholders.

Furthermore, the policy should be consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and not unnecessarily expose the company to unwarranted risk or liability.", "e6": "Yes. To better understand the CFO's concerns, I would ask: What is the expected reaction of large institutional investors if we disclose our true earnings?
