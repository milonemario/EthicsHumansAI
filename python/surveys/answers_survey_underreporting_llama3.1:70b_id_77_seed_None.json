Although some investors may initially be caught off guard by the change, they will ultimately benefit from a more accurate representation of the company's earnings. The CFO's concerns about short-term market reactions and potential impacts on retail investors are valid but should not outweigh the long-term benefits of transparent financial reporting.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, avoiding any intentional omissions or misrepresentations that could mislead stakeholders. It's also essential to consider the potential impact on various groups, including retail investors who may not have the same level of financial sophistication as institutional investors. In the context of public companies, ethical reporting policies should prioritize fairness, honesty, and accountability, ultimately contributing to a more informed and efficient market.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. How long has the current policy been in place and what were the original reasons for implementing the under-reporting bias?
