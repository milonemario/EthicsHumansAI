It could expose the firm to legal liability or an investigation by the SEC. Therefore, a change to the new policy without bias would be more transparent and ethical, even if it causes short-term volatility in the stock price. While there are concerns about retail investors being disadvantaged by market savvy funds, maintaining the status quo only perpetuates this issue. A better solution might involve educating retail investors on financial reporting to ensure they fully understand any changes.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should accurately represent a company's financial performance, fostering transparency and investor confidence. It should minimize deception or manipulation, such as biased financial reporting. Considerations should include upholding the public interest and maintaining investors' trust in the fairness of financial disclosures. In this case, changing to an unbiased policy is not only ethical but also imperative as it complies with regulatory requirements, ensuring a level playing field for all investors, and addressing concerns over legal liability.", "e6": "While it is notable that investors are aware of the current EPS bias, I would ask for further clarification on how retail investors compare to sophisticated hedge funds in understanding and trading based on financial reporting changes. Also, discuss alternative mitigation strategies towards ensuring fairness for small investors without exposing the firm to legal liabilities or potential investigations by regulatory bodies. The board should consider educating investors on financial reporting or provide guidance on accurate earnings estimation, if any changes to the current policy are made.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 5}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "The first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system was Oumuamua, discovered in October 2017.", "q10": "A"}
