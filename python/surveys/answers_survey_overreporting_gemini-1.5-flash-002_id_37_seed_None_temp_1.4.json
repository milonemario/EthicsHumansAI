Although a temporary stock price dip is possible, the transition to transparent reporting is ultimately more beneficial.

It aims to present a fair and accurate representation of the company's financial performance without manipulation or intentional misdirection.  It also considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be less sophisticated, striving for clear and easily understandable communication.  Consistency over time is also key to build trust.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the change in accounting policy to investors and mitigate the anticipated negative market reaction.
