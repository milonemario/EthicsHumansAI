While the new policy carries risk of investor misinterpretation, transparency and honesty are paramount.  The long-term reputational damage from the current policy outweighs the short-term market reaction concerns, particularly considering the potential for investor trust to be eroded over time.  A shift to a transparent system, even with potential initial hiccups, is the more responsible and sustainable approach.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any intentional misrepresentation, even if seemingly understood by some stakeholders.  Materiality, clarity, and comparability across reporting periods are crucial.  The policy should be clearly documented and consistently applied, demonstrating a commitment to investor trust and fair market practices.  External factors like industry norms and relevant regulations should also be considered.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd want to understand the specific predicted investor reactions to the new policy, including the potential magnitude and duration of any negative impacts.  Also, what specific steps are being taken to educate investors about the change and manage their potential misunderstandings?
