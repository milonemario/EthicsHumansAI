Long-term investor trust and confidence are built on transparency and honesty. While some investors might misinterpret the new policy, the ultimate goal of accurate reporting should prevail. The potential for short-term market fluctuations is a risk worth taking to establish a more ethical and sustainable financial reporting practice.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness.  It avoids deliberate manipulation or obfuscation of information, ensuring all stakeholders have access to a clear and unbiased understanding of the company's financial performance.  It should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups, striving for equitable access to information and avoiding practices that could disadvantage less sophisticated investors.  Compliance with all applicable accounting standards and regulations is crucial.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific mechanisms used to bias earnings previously,  the plan to communicate the policy change clearly to investors, and a detailed risk assessment outlining potential short-term market reactions and mitigation strategies.
