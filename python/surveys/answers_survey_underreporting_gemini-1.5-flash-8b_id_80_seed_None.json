The new policy, while potentially creating challenges for investor relations in the short term, aligns better with transparency and ethical financial reporting.  In the long run, maintaining a reputation for honesty is more valuable than short-term gains from misleading practices.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents a clear, unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any intentional manipulation or misrepresentation, even if some investors might misinterpret the data.  Considerations like investor sophistication, potential market reactions, and the long-term impact on the company's reputation are all important factors in evaluating the ethical implications of a reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask about the potential impact of the new policy on investor relations in the short term, strategies to educate investors about the change, and contingency plans for handling any negative market reactions.  I would also inquire about the specific data points and analysis supporting the expectation that investors will still adjust reported earnings upwards by 50 cents in the absence of the prior bias, and whether the anticipated negative investor reaction is a result of historical trading patterns rather than a fundamental misinterpretation of the updated data.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
