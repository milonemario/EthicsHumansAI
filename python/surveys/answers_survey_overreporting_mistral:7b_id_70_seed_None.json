The potential short-term market reactions can be managed by transparent communication about the change in policy and ensuring that all investors, including retail ones, are treated fairly. Ultimately, long-term growth and sustainability require honest financial reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and fair to all investors, without intentionally misleading or providing an unfair advantage to certain groups. A bias towards over-reporting earnings, even when understood by the investor community, represents a breach of trust, exposes the firm to legal liability, and disadvantages retail investors. While changes in policy may trigger short-term market reactions, long-term sustainability requires a focus on honest financial reporting that ensures consistency, fairness, and adherence to both ethical norms and legal expectations.", "e6": "In addition to understanding why the policy has been maintained for years, I would inquire about alternative ways to communicate the change in policy effectively without misleading investors and potentially putting retail investors at a disadvantage.
