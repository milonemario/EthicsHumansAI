It should not deceive or mislead investors, but rather provide them with reliable information to make informed decisions. Additionally, the policy should be fair and consistent, avoiding any practices that could disproportionately benefit certain groups at the expense of others. In this context, the current policy's bias towards under-reporting earnings creates a predictable pattern for investors, while the new policy's change might confuse or disadvantage retail investors who do not adjust their expectations.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask if there are plans to educate retail investors on the change in policy or provide guidance on how to adjust their investment decisions accordingly.
