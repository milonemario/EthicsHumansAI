Firstly, transparency and honest financial reporting are crucial for maintaining investor trust. Secondly, changing to an unwarranted bias could expose the company to legal liability or an investigation by the SEC. Lastly, while the change may cause a temporary disadvantage to retail investors, it is unjustifiable to further advantage hedge funds at their expense.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy, in this situation, would be transparent and truthful about the earnings per share (EPS) to investors. Ideal characteristics include ensuring accurate financial reporting, promoting investor trust, protecting retail investors from exploitation, avoiding legal liabilities or investigations by regulatory bodies, and maintaining reputation among stakeholders. It is essential that the policy is consistent, understandable, and avoids biases, and any changes to the reporting policies must be communicated clearly.", "e6": "I would have several follow-up questions for the management team, including: Could you elaborate on any specific legal counsel concerns that have prompted this discussion about changing the reported earnings bias? Are there any instances of legal infringements or investigations currently underway related to ABC\u2019s financial reporting practices? Have potential shareholders been consulted regarding their preference for full disclosure versus the current practice, and if so, are there any plans to engage with them further on this topic? Could you delineate the scope of your 'investor relations team' and its role in communicating changes in company policies? Specifically, is there a strategy or plan prepared to address potential resistance from retail investors who may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with no-bias earnings reporting?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "C", "q9": "This question pertains to the dilemma faced by the board member, not to an interstellar object passing through our solar system.
