Moreover, adopting an unbiased reporting policy aligns with ethical business practices and reduces the risk of regulatory scrutiny.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and honesty. This means providing clear, unbiased, and comprehensive information that allows stakeholders to make informed decisions.
