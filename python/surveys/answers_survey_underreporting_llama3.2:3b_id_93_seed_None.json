Implementing a new policy that requires immediate adjustment could result in temporary market fluctuations and potential financial harm to these investors. Instead, I suggest implementing the new policy gradually, with clear communication to investors about the changes and potential impacts. This approach would allow for a smoother transition and minimize the risk of unintended consequences.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should accurately reflect a company's financial performance without misleading investors about its true earnings capacity. This means providing consistent and comparable information over time. Additionally, the policy should avoid unfair advantages or disadvantages to specific groups of investors. Considerations such as stakeholder interests and the level of investor sophistication also play a role in evaluating the ethicality of a reporting policy. Ultimately, an honest and transparent policy helps maintain trust between companies and their investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask additional questions. Specifically, I would like to know more about how the company plans to address potential negative reactions from small investors or those who were previously taking advantage of the known bias adjustment. Additionally, what contingency planning does the company have in place to mitigate any market fluctuations that may result from implementing a new policy?
