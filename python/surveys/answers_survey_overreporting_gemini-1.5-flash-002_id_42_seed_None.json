Although a short-term stock price dip is possible due to investor misinterpretations, the transparency of the new policy is more valuable.

Transparency about the reporting methodology itself is also key to building trust.", "e6": "I would ask about a detailed communication plan to accompany the policy change, addressing how they will proactively educate investors about the shift to unbiased reporting and mitigate potential negative market reactions.
