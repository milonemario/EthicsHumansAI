Maintaining trust with investors, even sophisticated ones, is paramount.

A transparent approach is the superior strategy for building long-term value and investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and fairness.  It presents a true and unbiased reflection of the company's financial performance, without intentional manipulation or misleading omissions.  It considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, ensuring consistent application of accounting standards and avoiding practices that favor certain investor groups.  Contextual factors, like industry norms, should not justify unethical shortcuts.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific investor relations strategies used to communicate the past earnings, and how they plan to communicate the change in policy to mitigate negative market reactions.
