Additionally, considering the potential for future liability risks and accountability would indicate that board members value responsible business practices over short-term gains.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask: What explicit guarantees or disclaimers will be provided to ensure investors understand that biases in earnings reporting are not a product of manipulation but rather a characteristic of corporate operations under the current environment?
