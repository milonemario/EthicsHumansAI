While the current policy might seem less problematic in the short-term,  switching to the new policy, even with some investor misinterpretation, builds trust and fosters a more sustainable business relationship. Transparency and honesty, though potentially disruptive initially, are crucial for long-term investor confidence and overall company health.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any intentional misrepresentation, even if investors might anticipate adjustments.  Materiality, the potential impact on investor decisions, is crucial.  The policy should clearly communicate the company's financial performance without bias, ensuring all stakeholders receive the same information.  Finally, the policy should be consistently applied, regardless of short-term market pressures or investor expectations.", "e6": "Yes. I'd want to understand the specific quantitative impact (e.g., EPS) the new policy might have on short-term investor sentiment and stock price.
