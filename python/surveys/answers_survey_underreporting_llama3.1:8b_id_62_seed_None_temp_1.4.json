This could result in legal liability or other consequences, potentially outweighing any potential benefits of reporting unbiased earnings, making changing the policy not recommended.", "e5": "In an ethical reporting policy, I would emphasize transparency and honesty. It should accurately reflect a company's financial situation, without intentionally distorting data for any purpose. It should not disadvantage one type of investor over another. Considerations include protecting the interests of all investors, not just favored or well-informed groups, and avoiding potential legal exposure with open reporting. This requires striking a balance between transparency and the impact of potentially revised market valuations on company capital and reputation.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask: What steps will be taken to ensure that investors who do understand and account for the bias in the current policy do not immediately sell at a significant loss when the transition is made?
