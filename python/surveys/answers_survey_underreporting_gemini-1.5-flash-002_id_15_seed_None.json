Transparency, even if it leads to initial negative market reaction, is crucial for a company's reputation and sustainable success. The potential for unfair advantage for sophisticated investors under the current policy is also a significant ethical concern.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should present a fair and unbiased view of the company's financial performance, avoiding any intentional manipulation or misrepresentation.  The policy should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups, striving for fairness and preventing any group from gaining an unfair advantage due to the reporting method.  Clear and consistent application of accounting standards is also crucial.", "e6": "I would ask for a detailed analysis of the potential short-term market impact of switching policies, including specific strategies to manage investor communication and mitigate negative reactions.  I'd also want to understand the extent of the current bias and how it's been applied consistently over time, and what steps will be taken to ensure a smooth transition to the new, unbiased policy.
