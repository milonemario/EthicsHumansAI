Despite the CFO's concerns about market volatility and potential disadvantages for retail investors in the short term, changing to the new policy with unbiased reporting would be both ethically sound and accountable, ultimately benefiting the company and investors in the long run.", "e5": "An ethically sound reporting policy should prioritize accuracy, transparency, and accountability. In this case, the current practice of consistently over-reporting earnings per share is questionable due to its potential to mislead investors and expose the firm to legal liability or an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. While concerns about market volatility and disadvantages for smaller retail investors do play a part in the decision-making process, the long-term implications of ethically dubious actions could outweigh these short-term concerns. Ideally, a new policy with unbiased reporting would provide fairness to all investors, foster trust in the company, and uphold the board's responsibility for long-term sustainability and integrity.", "e6": "I would like to request more information regarding: 1) The potential impact of changing the reporting policy on the firm's long-term sustainability and integrity; 2) Any relevant data or research that supports the claim that sophisticated hedge funds would take advantage of smaller retail investors when the reporting policy changes; and 3) Alternative solutions or compromises to address the concerns mentioned by the CFO, such as implementing clear and effective communication strategies to educate all investors about the change in reporting policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "This scenario does not provide information about the first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system.", "q10": "D"}
