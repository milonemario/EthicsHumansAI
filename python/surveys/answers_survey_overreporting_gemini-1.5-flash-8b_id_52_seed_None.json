The current policy, while potentially misleading in its effect, is currently understood by the market and therefore, despite its ethical flaws, is less risky in the short term.  Maintaining the status quo allows for a more controlled transition to the new policy, allowing for investor education and adjustment to the new reporting format.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors through manipulation or omission of crucial information.  Context matters; a policy must consider the sophistication of investors and the potential for market impact.  Ultimately, it should be designed to foster trust and confidence, rather than exploit market volatility for short-term gain.", "e6": "Yes. I'd want to understand the projected impact of the new policy on stock price, including potential short-term volatility.  I'd also need a detailed plan for communicating the change to investors to mitigate negative reactions and ensure a smooth transition.

How can we ensure the fairness for all investors, regardless of their sophistication?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
