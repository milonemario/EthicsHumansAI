This can provide the time needed for investor relations teams to effectively communicate and acclimate the market, mitigating potential short-term penalties.", "e5": "The characteristics of an ethical reporting policy involve fairness, transparency, accuracy, and accountability. Reported earnings should aim to approximate cash flows that the investor might realistically expect upon ownership of the stock. Biases that distort true financial performance hinder sound investments, impeding trust between investors and firms. Considerations relevant in this context are addressing any legal risks, ensuring equitable treatment of retail and sophisticated investors, providing adequate communication in case of policy changes, minimizing market uncertainty, and maintaining consistent reporting standards for accurate performance assessments over time.", "e6": "Questions for management team would involve requesting additional evidence supporting or refuting the potential legal liability of continuing to practice the biased reporting policy, inquiring further about investor relations' efforts to effectively communicate changes in financial reporting if adopting the new policy, exploring alternatives to help alleviate potential hardships on retail investors from sophisticated investors' access to market information and analysis, clarifying strategies management plans to adopt for better retail investor protection and leveling the playing field moving forward. Furthermore, I'd like insight into how such reporting bias impacted major decisions over the board's tenure and if they should revisit previous actions.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "Investors may be aware but investors don't trade on facts, only information. There are sophisticated market participants who know it might lead to lower valuation, but a large group of general/retail investors will likely not account accurately in their estimations, leading unfairly to small investors, as well as possible further reevaluation by markets should more accurate reports be published that would negatively affect share prices. Although some risks may present over the short term, it arguably is more feasible for ABC's executive management to alter current earnings policies, since the company should aim at long-term value creation rather than short-term profits.", "q10": "B"}
