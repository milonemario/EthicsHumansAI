Switching to the new policy promotes transparency and aligns the company with higher ethical standards. Although there's a risk of short-term market reaction, building trust with investors through honesty is a more sustainable long-term strategy. The potential negative impact on less sophisticated investors is a concern, but it's mitigated by the overall increase in ethical practice.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It ensures all material information is fairly presented, avoiding deliberate manipulation or obfuscation.  It considers the needs of all investor classes, aiming for clarity and avoiding practices that could unduly advantage some investors over others.  It also demonstrates a commitment to consistent application over time, preventing arbitrary changes for short-term gain.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific plan to communicate the policy change to investors, including how they will address potential misunderstandings and maintain credibility.
