The CFO's concerns about investor understanding and potential short-term/long-term market impact need careful consideration before a change is made.  A more nuanced approach to address investor communications around the transition is needed, possibly with a detailed explanation, before fully committing to the policy change.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and consistently applied.  It avoids manipulation or bias, and clearly communicates any changes in methodology.  Crucially, it considers the impact on all stakeholders, including both sophisticated and retail investors.  Maintaining investor trust through clear communication about policy changes is paramount.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions about the specific plan for communicating the change to investors, the anticipated market reaction, and the potential impact on different investor segments (e.g., retail vs. institutional).  I'd also want to understand the modeling behind the projected market impact, and how the company plans to mitigate any potential negative consequences for retail investors.
