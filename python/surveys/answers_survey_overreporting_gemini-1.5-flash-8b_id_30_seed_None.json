The CFO's concerns about investor relations and potential disadvantage for small investors are significant enough to warrant caution before making such a change.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, avoiding any manipulation or deception, even if well-intentioned.  It should consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers.  Materiality, comparability, and consistency are also crucial; a policy should be understandable and easily comparable to previous reporting.  Finally, the policy should adhere to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and relevant regulations.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask for a detailed analysis of the potential market reaction to the new policy, including projected impact on stock price, potential investor sentiment shifts, and a specific comparison of the cost of maintaining the current policy versus the cost of the potential negative consequences of changing to the new policy.
