This adjustment, he fears, would lead investors trading against small investors, ultimately harming those who are less sophisticated.", "e5": "In my view, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should not intentionally mislead or deceive investors, nor should it create unfair trading advantages among different investor groups. The policy should also take into account the potential consequences of changing policies on vulnerable stakeholders, such as small investors. A more nuanced consideration would be to weigh the benefits of transparency against the potential costs of perceived market instability, and to balance the interests of different stakeholder groups in a fair and equitable manner.", "e6": "Yes. I would have several follow-up questions for the management team, including: What specific actions or steps are being proposed to implement the new policy? How will the company ensure that small investors are not disproportionately harmed by the change in reporting policy? Are there any contingency plans in place to mitigate potential market volatility resulting from the change? And, is there consideration being given to developing more sophisticated communication strategies to inform and educate the investor community about the differences between reported earnings under the old and new policies?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
