By adjusting earnings downwards in compliance with industry norms while appearing transparent in reported figures, more experienced investors stand to gain an informational advantage while retail investors benefit relatively little. This arrangement does not necessarily improve the company or society as adopting a truthful practice was already within reach without negative consequences. Hence sticking with known policy seems most rational.", "e5": "For a reporting policy to be considered ethical, it should be transparent, honest, and unbiased. The reported information should accurately reflect the company's situation, and no intentional misrepresentation of data or performance should be made. In this context, considerations such as protecting stakeholders' trust, promoting fair competition among investors, and preventing exploitation by more experienced investors become important.", "e6": "Yes. The follow-up questions I'd have for the management team include: What specific actions would be taken to adjust earnings without any apparent bias? How would communication of past adjusted earnings and their future absence to different investors groups handle?
