This outweighed the moral benefits of truthful reporting, leading me to recommend maintaining the current policy for business reasons.", "e5": "In my view, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and honesty. It should avoid deliberate misrepresentation or manipulation of data to influence investors' decisions. The policy should also take into account potential consequences for various stakeholders, including retail investors who may be disproportionately affected by changes in market conditions. Additionally, it's essential to weigh the benefits of truthful reporting against any perceived drawbacks, considering whether they are outweighed by potential negative impacts on stakeholders. In this context, a 'no-bias' policy was still considered unwise due to concerns about investor expectations and fair treatment among investors.", "e6": "Yes. I would have a follow-up question for the management team, specifically the CFO. Do we have any data or evidence that suggests the benefits of maintaining the current policy outweigh the drawbacks, particularly in terms of potential investor relations and brand reputation consequences if the 'no-bias' policy was adopted?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 2, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 2, "d": 3, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
