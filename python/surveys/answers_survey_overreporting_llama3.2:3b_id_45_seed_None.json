The current practice helps them make informed decisions by being aware of the bias, whereas the new policy risks exposing small investors to market volatility and penalties from sophisticated hedge funds who understand the adjusted earnings. Additionally, the CFO's concerns about the investor relations team being unable to communicate the change without incurring a backlash are valid, making a switch to unbiased reporting a high-risk proposition for the company's investors.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical when it provides transparent and accurate information to investors, without misleading or deceiving them. This requires a balance between disclosing potential risks and biases and avoiding unnecessary complexity that might confuse investors. The policy should also consider the needs of small investors who may rely on simple, understandable explanations. Additionally, the policy should ensure consistency and fairness across all reports, preventing selective disclosure of information that could be used to gain an unfair advantage. This approach fosters trust and confidence in the company's reporting, essential for long-term investor relations.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "B", "q9": "2011 UW3 (also known as 'Oumuamua')", "q10": "B"}
