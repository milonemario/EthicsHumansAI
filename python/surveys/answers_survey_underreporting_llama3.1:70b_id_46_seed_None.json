Although some investors may initially be confused or disadvantaged, the company's long-term reputation and credibility will benefit from accurate and unbiased reporting. The potential risks of the SEC investigating or litigating against the company under the current policy also outweigh any short-term advantages of maintaining the status quo.", "e5": "I would consider a reporting policy to be ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that financial reports should reflect the true performance of the company, without any intentional misstatements or omissions. The policy should also be consistent and follow established accounting standards. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the potential impact on various stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, and the broader community. In this context, a reporting policy that prioritizes transparency and honesty, even if it may lead to short-term challenges, is more likely to be viewed as ethical and responsible.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. How do you plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and analysts? What steps will be taken to ensure a smooth transition and minimize any potential disruption to the company's stock price or operations?

Lastly, what is the timeline for implementing the new policy and have all relevant stakeholders been informed?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (1I/2017 U1), discovered on October 19, 2017", "q10": "B"}
