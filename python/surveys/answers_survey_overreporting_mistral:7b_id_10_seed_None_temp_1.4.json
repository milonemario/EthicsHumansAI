The benefits achieved through biased reporting are questionable due to already existing market expectations. As such, while understanding retail investors can easily be influenced or misled, transitioning smoothly to an honest and unbiased policy should serve everyone's best interest over time in terms of credibility and reputation, particularly after thorough explanation and investor education on the changes.", "e5": "For reporting policy to be ethical, it must accurately represent the underlying company performance to all stakeholders with transparency and credibility. By providing consistently biased earnings per share reports, even though the biases are accepted among the investor community \u2013 investors cannot solely account for them or have confidence in long term returns. To maintain investors' trust - particularly retail ones, who may rely on simple financial performance evaluations \u2013 it is vital that we embrace the change towards an unbiased earnings reporting policy. This would ensure a level playing field and equitable opportunities to sophisticated and smaller pools of investors based on knowledge rather than unverified insider information.", "e6": "As the CFO's concerns highlight an understandable preference to maintain market perceptions and prevent potential investor confusion, I would question further about how a swift transition to honest reporting can be achieved through effective communication strategies targeting all groups of investors.
