Adopting transparency and honesty in financial statements is imperative for long-term success and ethical reputation. Although there might be immediate market volatility or short-term disadvantages for retail investors, the long-term benefits of upholding integrity outweigh potential consequences. The company's decision to avoid legal liability and potential investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission justifies the change towards the new unbiased policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy for ABC should be transparent, honest, and accurate to promote investor trust. The current bias in earnings reporting may mislead less-informed investors or those who are unable to adjust the reported EPS. To maintain a positive long-term relationship with investors, management must prioritize truthfulness and integrity over perceived short-term market advantages. By avoiding legal complications and preserving a solid reputation, ABC can effectively align its reporting policy with ethical standards for responsible financial practices.", "e6": "Based on my understanding of the scenario, there are some additional questions that could benefit clarification from the management team. I would seek further information regarding previous attempts to change reporting practices and reasons for their failure. Additionally, I would like to understand the rationale behind the belief that only sophisticated investors will adjust earnings calculations appropriately and the potential impact this has on retail investors' investment decisions. Lastly, I would request data on how the company communicates changes in financial reporting policy to investors in order to ensure transparency and avoid confusion.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "A", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
