The current policy exposes the firm to legal risks, and it is not fair for shareholders, particularly retail investors. Despite concerns about investor relations and communicating the change in policy, it is crucial to take action towards improving ABC's reputation for honesty and fostering trust with all stakeholders.", "e5": "As a board member, an ethical reporting policy should be honest, transparent, and unbiased, ensuring that investors receive accurate information to make informed decisions. Legal liability or investigations stemming from inaccurate reporting could damage the company's reputation. Although some investors may adjust EPS downward due to their familiarity with the current practice, it does create an uneven playing field between sophisticated investors and retail ones. The new policy should aim for fairness in reporting and close this gap. Communication of the change might be challenging but upholding integrity is paramount.", "e6": "Given the potential ethical and legal issues, I would ask about investigating other solutions for addressing investor relations concerns while moving towards the new policy with unbiased reporting. For example, could a communications plan be developed to explain the new strategy's benefits and rationale? Additionally, measures can be taken to educate retail investors to ensure fair understanding of ABC's financial reporting on an equal basis with sophisticated investors.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 1, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "", "q10": "D"}
