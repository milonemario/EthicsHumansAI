Considering the context of ABC, a new unbiased reporting policy would provide full disclosure to investors while minimizing potential legal and reputational risks. It is crucial that such a change in policy ensures that no one group (such as retail investors) is disadvantaged or hurt financially due to insufficient communication about the change or understanding of the context.
