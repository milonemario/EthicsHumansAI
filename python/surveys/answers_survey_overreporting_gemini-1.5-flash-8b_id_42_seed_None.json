The market's reaction to a perceived earnings decline, especially if investors don't immediately adjust to the new policy, could damage the stock price and negatively impact retail investors.  Preserving shareholder value, including those with less sophisticated investment strategies, takes precedence over a potential long-term ethical advantage in this scenario.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy.  It should clearly communicate the method of earnings calculation and avoid any misleading or deceptive practices.  Context matters, as investors' sophistication levels and market conditions influence how information is interpreted.  A policy should not intentionally obscure facts or create situations where investors might be unfairly disadvantaged.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed financial impact analysis of the potential stock price reaction under the new policy, including estimations for both positive and negative scenarios.
