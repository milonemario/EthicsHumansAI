First, it promotes transparency and honesty in financial reporting. Although investors are currently adjusting for the bias, this practice may not be sustainable or fair in the long run. Additionally, maintaining a biased reporting system can expose the company to legal liabilities. By adopting an unbiased policy, we ensure that all stakeholders have access to accurate information, which is essential for making informed decisions.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that financial information should be presented in a clear and straightforward manner, without any intentional omissions or distortions. The policy should also be consistent and reliable, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. Additionally, consideration should be given to the potential impact on various stakeholder groups, such as retail investors who may not have the same level of financial sophistication as institutional investors. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes fairness, honesty, and accountability.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to communicate the change in policy to investors and stakeholders. Specifically, I would like to know what steps they will take to ensure that all parties are aware of the new policy and understand its implications.
