It fairly presents the company's financial performance without manipulation or bias.  It considers the needs of all stakeholders, not just short-term investor expectations.  Compliance with all applicable accounting standards and regulations is crucial.  Furthermore, the policy should be clearly communicated to investors to avoid any misinterpretations.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific methods used to bias earnings in the past, the potential impact on different investor groups (beyond retail vs. hedge funds), and what communication plan they have to address the market's initial reaction to the new, unbiased policy.
