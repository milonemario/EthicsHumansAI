As a board member, it is imperative for ABC to cultivate investor relationship based on trust and integrity; the current policy of bias reporting contests a positive investment image we strive toward as the company grows steadily every year. Retail investors who suffer under the status quo and are vulnerable to the risks of unforeseen biased losses ought to be prioritized, and I strongly believe it's the right decision to level the field in trading activity moving forward.", "e5": "Reporting policies, such as that employed by ABC, appear untrustworthy and nontransparent through the consistent bias displayed in reported earnings. To consider a policy ethical it should be truthful without alterations and prioritize the confidence entrusted by its investors; avoiding ambiguity in the disclosure of important financial information and acting dutifully against conflicts of interest for share equity raises. The well-understood, market accepted adjustments to reported numbers, as highlighted by the CFO, show that current reporting methods exploit common knowledge among large investment groups. Adopting a policy devoid of bias will align ethical practices with the firm's fiduciary responsibility and promote transparency while allowing equal opportunity in the distribution of accurate information to our valued retail investors.", "e6": "I would follow up with a series of questions to help clarify potential negative future implications for investors, as highlighted by the CFO's explanation. The board should assess whether the current unfair biased advantage in favor large investment groups is justified; and if so, identify possible protective provisions to mitigate any detrimental impact on their retail clients who depend most heavily on us as trustworthy public figures making investment decisions that cater best towards long-term, steady growth opportunities. We must be conscientious of aiding the retail investors who are at greater vulnerability to external risks while fostering ethical practices within our organization that prioritizes the interests of its invested clientele.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "D", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": {"1st answer": "First Interstellar Object passing through our solar system: Oumuamua, named 'the Scout' in Hawaiian, is the first known interstellar object observed passing through or entering into the Solar System.
