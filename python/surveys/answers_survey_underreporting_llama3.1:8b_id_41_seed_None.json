Given these potential downsides, it may not be in the best interest of all stakeholders to change to the new policy.", "e5": "In my view, an ethical reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and consistent. It should avoid misleading investors or stakeholders, either by omission or commission. The new policy's failure to acknowledge the previous bias would likely be viewed as a lack of transparency, which could erode trust and credibility with investors. In general, I believe that a reporting policy should prioritize clarity and honesty in presenting financial information, while also being mindful of its potential impact on different types of stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to investigate further several points, including: What specific steps would be taken to inform investors about the change in policy and to prevent them from adjusting their estimates of EPS upward by 50 cents?
