As a board member, my responsibility is to prioritize the well-being of all stakeholders, including retail investors. By maintaining the current policy, we can ensure that these investors have access to reliable information and make informed decisions. While there are also benefits to being transparent about the earnings bias, I believe it's essential to balance this with caution to avoid causing unintended harm.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that provides transparent and accurate information to stakeholders, while also considering their needs and potential vulnerabilities. This includes being honest about any biases or adjustments made to financial data. An effective policy should also facilitate clear communication and understanding of the underlying assumptions and methodologies used in the reporting process. Additionally, the policy should be free from coercion, manipulation, or exploitation, and should prioritize fairness, consistency, and accountability.", "e6": "Yes. To further inform my decision, I would like to ask management team representatives about their assessment of the potential risks and benefits of implementing a transparency plan that discloses the earnings bias, how they plan to educate retail investors on this adjustment, and whether there are any plans to review or update the policy in light of changing market conditions or new regulatory requirements.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 5, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "B", "q9": "2011 AG5", "q10": "B"}
