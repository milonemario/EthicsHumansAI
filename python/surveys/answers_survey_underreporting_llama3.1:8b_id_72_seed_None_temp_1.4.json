The board member suggests this and weighs this potential cost against achieving a higher standard of honesty in public financial reports.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency by accurately reflecting a company's financial reality, rather than inflating or under-reporting figures to conceal actual performance. It's not just about disclosing information in truth but also with an intention that shareholders have the same level of fairness as all parties. Considerations like treating smaller investors favorably over larger would further compound any perception. Clear explanations behind changes to policies are vital to instill genuine comprehension among stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes. What proportion of our investors have correctly anticipated these future earnings biases over many years? Are there historical analyses that quantify this behavior and compare performance outcomes to expectations, considering this understanding's influence on stock price, volatility, etc.?
