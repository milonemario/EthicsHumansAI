Maintaining the current policy, despite its potential ethical gray areas, seems to be the least risky course of action in the short term and protects the interests of the wider investor base.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy.  It should clearly communicate the company's financial performance without manipulation or misleading information.  Contextual factors like investor expectations, market conditions, and the potential impact on various stakeholder groups (including retail investors) are crucial considerations in determining the ethical implications of a policy.  A truly ethical approach requires careful consideration of all relevant parties and a commitment to fair and honest representation of the company's financial health.", "e6": "Yes, I'd want to understand the specific projected negative market reactions to the new policy, particularly regarding the potential for retail investor harm. I'd also want to know if there are any alternative communications strategies to help minimize that harm while maintaining transparency.
