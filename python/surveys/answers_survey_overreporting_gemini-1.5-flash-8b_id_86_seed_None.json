A measured transition, perhaps with investor communication and education, would be required before changing to the new policy, ensuring a smooth market adjustment rather than a potentially damaging one.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deception, even if seemingly beneficial in the short term.  Key considerations include avoiding material misrepresentation, ensuring consistent application, and providing adequate disclosure to investors regarding any potential impacts of the policy on reported results.  Ultimately, the policy must foster trust and confidence in the company's financial reporting, even in periods of significant change or challenge.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask for a detailed market analysis predicting the potential negative reaction to the new policy, including specific scenarios and estimated impacts on stock price and investor sentiment.  I would also seek detailed information on how the new policy will impact retail investors and how they will be supported through the transition. Finally, I would inquire about the feasibility of a phased implementation or communication strategy to mitigate any potential investor confusion or damage.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
