Maintaining a transparent and unbiased earnings reporting system, even with potential short-term market reactions, fosters long-term investor trust and the company's reputation.  The current policy, while allowing for a form of investor adjustment, is inherently deceptive and undermines the integrity of the financial reporting process.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any intentional manipulation or bias in reported figures, ensuring that financial statements accurately reflect the company's performance.  Considerations like investor sophistication and market reaction should not drive policy decisions if those reactions are based on a fundamental misrepresentation.  Ultimately, ethical reporting fosters trust and a level playing field for all investors.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd want to understand the potential magnitude of the short-term market reaction to the policy change, including the estimated timeframe for the adjustment and potential strategies to mitigate negative investor sentiment.  Also, what specific steps were taken to ensure that the previous policy was correctly communicated to investors and that the bias was not considered a misrepresentation in the market.
