Although some investors may initially adjust the reported earnings downward due to habit, this is a short-term issue that can be mitigated through clear communication of the policy change. In the long run, adopting an unbiased reporting policy will foster trust with investors and reduce the risk of reputational damage or regulatory issues. It's essential to prioritize honest and fair disclosure over potential short-term market volatility.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should clearly communicate financial information to stakeholders without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. In the context of public companies like ABC, this means avoiding artificial inflation of earnings to support stock prices. Considerations such as investor sophistication, materiality of disclosed information, and consistency with regulatory requirements also play a role in evaluating the ethics of a reporting policy. Furthermore, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize fairness, honesty, and timeliness to maintain stakeholder trust and confidence.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. How do they plan to communicate the policy change to investors and stakeholders? What steps will be taken to ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential disruptions in the market? Are there any plans to re-educate or provide additional guidance to investors who may still adjust earnings due to habit? Additionally, I would like to know if there are any contingency plans in place to address potential short-term volatility in case some investors do not immediately understand the policy change.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
