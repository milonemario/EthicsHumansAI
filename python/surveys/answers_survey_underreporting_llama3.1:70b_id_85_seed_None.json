Although some investors may initially be surprised or confused by the change, ultimately it is better for the company to report its earnings truthfully rather than maintaining a biased reporting practice. This change will also help the company avoid potential legal liabilities and improve its credibility with investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and truthfulness. It should clearly and honestly convey the company's financial situation to stakeholders, without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. In addition, consideration should be given to the potential impact on vulnerable investors, such as retail investors who may not have the same level of access to information as sophisticated institutional investors. The policy should also comply with relevant laws and regulations and be consistent with the company's values and mission.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and analysts, including any specific steps they will take to ensure that all stakeholders understand the impact of the change.
