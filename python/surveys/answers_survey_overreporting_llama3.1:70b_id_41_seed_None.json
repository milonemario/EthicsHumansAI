It should provide accurate and reliable information to stakeholders, without any intention to mislead or deceive. The policy should also be consistent, easily understandable, and accessible to all investors, regardless of their level of sophistication. Additionally, it's essential to consider the potential impact on vulnerable stakeholders, such as retail investors, and ensure that the policy does not create unfair advantages for certain groups. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes fairness, integrity, and accountability, even if it requires short-term adjustments or challenges.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more details on their plan for communicating the policy change to investors, particularly small retail investors who may be most affected.
