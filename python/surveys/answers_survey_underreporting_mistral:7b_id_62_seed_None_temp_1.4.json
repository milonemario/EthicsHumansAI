Conversely, if not adequately communicated, making unbiased reporting could lead to short and long-term negative price movements among less attention retail investors. In view of potential legal liabilities, investor harm, increased transparency, and upholding trust within the community, it is advisable for the company to transition to the new policy withoutbias with strategic methods of transparent communication for a smooth adoption process", "e5": "An ethical earnings reporting policy provides full, accurate and transparent details of a company's financial performance to all investors. In this context, relevant characteristics would be unbiased reports regarding true earnings per share, following industry norms, guidelines, and SEC regulations; ensuring investors make informed, reliable decisions in good faith, enhancing trust among various stakeholders; maintaining transparency in the communication process and allowing a consistent basis for comparison across firms; minimizing harm toward investors with no opportunity to take an advantage by foreknowledge of imminent earnings surprises. To summarize, in line with the ethical principles promoting integrity, fairness, accountability, and transparency, a responsible and informative reporting policy fosters trust, credibility, confidence, and growth among investors towards achieving the long-term viability and success for both company leadership and shareholders.", "e6": "Question 1: How is the management team addressing legal concerns given potential increased scrutiny from regulators due to the lack of transparency?

Additionally, considering the ethical and reputational implications of persisting with this reporting practice while it carries increased risks and potential negative repercussions, what additional insights can management provide with respect to their long-term vision and commitment to a sustainable investor base and trustful stewardship.
