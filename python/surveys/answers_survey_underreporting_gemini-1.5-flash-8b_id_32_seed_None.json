The current policy, despite its manipulation, appears to provide a predictable framework for investor expectations. Changing policies without a clear understanding of the market's response could be detrimental to the company's overall financial health.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or misleading information, even if done seemingly for good reasons.  Crucially, it considers the impact on all stakeholders, not just sophisticated investors, and maintains a degree of predictability in investor expectations, especially important for long-term stability.  A policy that is both truthful and consistent is key.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd want to understand the precise mechanics of the current bias, the historical relationship between the reported and true EPS,  the predicted impact of the new policy on the market (particularly short-term), and alternative strategies for investor communication and education about the policy change. I'd also want to explore the specific worries regarding the retail investors; are they tangible fears with quantifiable consequences? Finally, what strategies exist for hedging against potential negative market reactions?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
