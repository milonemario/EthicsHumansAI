The current process is well-established and anticipated by investors, minimizing risks of misrepresentation claims. Changing to a no-bias rule may create uncertainty, especially when accompanied by potential earnings losses, making this scenario inconclusive.", "e5": "In evaluating a reporting policy, I consider both the intrinsic and extrinsic impact. I look for policies that are transparent, avoid intentional misrepresentation or selective disclosure, and consistently follow established methodologies (intrinsic integrity). At the same time, I recognize external factors such as investor behavior and market dynamics. A policy must demonstrate consideration of how investors respond to information disclosures \u2013 providing fair notice and minimizing potential bias in decision-making by either party.", "e6": "Yes.
