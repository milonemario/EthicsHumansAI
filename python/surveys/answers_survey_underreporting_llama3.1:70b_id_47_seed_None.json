Although a change may lead to short-term market volatility, it reduces the risk of regulatory scrutiny and potential liabilities. Additionally, it treats all investors equally, regardless of their level of sophistication, which is essential for maintaining trust in the capital markets. The benefits of adopting an unbiased policy outweigh the potential short-term costs.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, unbiased, accurate, and consistent. It should provide stakeholders with a truthful representation of the company's performance, without intentional omissions or misrepresentations. The policy should also be free from conflicts of interest and not privilege certain groups over others. Furthermore, it should comply with relevant laws and regulations, such as those related to securities disclosure. In this context, consideration should also be given to the potential impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may not have equal access to information or market influence.", "e6": "What is the planned communication strategy to inform investors, analysts, and other stakeholders about the change in reporting policy?
