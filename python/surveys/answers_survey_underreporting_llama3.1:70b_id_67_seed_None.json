This means providing stakeholders with complete and reliable information, free from manipulation or misrepresentation. An ethical reporting policy promotes trust, accountability, and informed decision-making. In the context of financial reporting, additional considerations include compliance with relevant regulations and accounting standards, as well as consistency in application to facilitate comparability.
