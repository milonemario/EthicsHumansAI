The sophisticated hedge funds that are more attentive to this type of issue would already be able to navigate the adjusted earnings. Changing the policy now could lead to unintended consequences for the company's stock price and investor confidence, which outweighs any perceived benefits of transparency.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical when it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should clearly communicate the methodology used to calculate earnings per share, avoid misleading information, and provide context for investors to make informed decisions. Additionally, the policy should align with regulatory requirements and industry standards, while also considering the potential impact on stakeholders such as retail investors. A reporting policy that balances these factors is more likely to be viewed as ethical, even if it means being transparent about biases or limitations in the earnings calculation.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for further clarification on the proposed changes to the reporting policy and how they will be communicated to investors.
