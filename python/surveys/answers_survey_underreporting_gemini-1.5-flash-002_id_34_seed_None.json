Maintaining the current policy is ethically questionable and unsustainable.  The new policy promotes trust and long-term investor confidence, which is ultimately more valuable.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents a fair and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding manipulation or intentional obfuscation.  It considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, not just investors, and ensures consistent application of accounting standards.  Furthermore, clear communication about the reporting methods is crucial to avoid misinterpretations.  The policy should strive to build trust, even if it means short-term market fluctuations.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to employ to communicate the policy change effectively to all investor groups.  I'd also want to understand the potential financial impact of the change, including a detailed analysis of both short-term and long-term implications, and what contingency plans are in place to mitigate risks. Finally, I would inquire about the process for ongoing review and potential future adjustments to the reporting policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
