The board should develop a comprehensive communication strategy about the change in financial reporting, emphasizing transparency and investor protection, while educating retail investors on their rights to unconflicted data. A gradual and timely transition can minimize potential market impact and level the playing field for all investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be unbiased, transparent, consistent with accurate measurement of earnings per share, honest, and devoid of manipulations. Reporting a firm's financial performance without bias fosters confidence in the validity of information being shared with the market, prevents any conflicts resulting from legal liability or external investigations, and minimizes potential harmful effects on smaller investors at a disadvantage. Enhancing accessibility to clear data can empower all stakeholders, promote fair value estimation, and support well-informed trading decisions. A successful transition might consider a communications strategy and investor education programs.", "e6": "To better clarify the situation and to protect ABC's interests, I would ask the management team some key questions. Firstly, should the board consider providing a grace period for investors to properly adjust to any adjustments in the financial reporting?
