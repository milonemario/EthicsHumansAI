The new policy, though potentially unsettling to investors initially, fosters transparency and honesty, aligning with long-term investor trust and good corporate governance.  The potential for misunderstanding by some investors should be managed with clear communication and investor relations strategy rather than maintaining the deception of the current policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and truthfulness.  It avoids manipulation, even if well-intended, and strives for accuracy in presenting financial performance.  This includes clear communication to stakeholders about any changes in reporting methods and the reasons behind them.  The policy should also consider the potential impact on various investor types, aiming to avoid unfairly disadvantaging any group while maintaining overall trust and confidence.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd ask for a detailed plan outlining how the new policy will be communicated to investors, especially retail investors, to mitigate potential negative reactions.  Also, what strategies are in place to address potential trading advantages for sophisticated investors and how will we monitor and respond to market reactions?  Finally, what is the anticipated impact on the company's stock price in the short term, and how will we manage investor concerns during the transition?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
