Adopting the new policy demonstrates a commitment to ethical conduct and accurate financial reporting, which builds trust with investors in the long run. Even if there is temporary confusion during the transition, it is ethically sounder to prioritize transparency and truthful communication.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and completeness. It avoids intentional manipulation or obfuscation of financial information, even if it's perceived to benefit the company in the short term.  Effective communication with investors is crucial, clearly explaining any changes in accounting policies and their impact on reported figures. Ultimately, an ethical policy aims to build trust by providing stakeholders with a clear and reliable understanding of the company's financial performance.", "e6": "I would ask management to develop a comprehensive communication plan for transitioning to the new policy.  This plan should clearly explain the change to investors, including the reasons behind it and how it will affect reported earnings going forward.
