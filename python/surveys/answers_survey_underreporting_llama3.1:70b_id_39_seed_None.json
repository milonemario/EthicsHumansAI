Although some investors may initially be surprised or adjust their expectations, the long-term benefits of accurate reporting outweigh any short-term market adjustments. The new policy aligns reported earnings with actual performance, reducing the likelihood of future legal liability or regulatory scrutiny. Furthermore, it builds trust with investors and stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to transparency and integrity.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and unbiased. This means that reported information should accurately reflect the company's financial performance without any deliberate attempts to mislead or deceive stakeholders. The policy should also be consistent and reliable, allowing investors to make informed decisions. Additionally, consideration should be given to the potential impact on vulnerable stakeholders, such as retail investors who may not have access to the same level of information as institutional investors. Overall, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes fairness, integrity, and accountability.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. What steps will be taken to educate investors about the change in reporting policy? How will the company manage potential short-term market volatility resulting from this change? Are there any plans to adjust other financial metrics or disclosures to ensure consistency and accuracy? Additionally, what measures will be put in place to monitor and evaluate the impact of this change on stakeholders, particularly retail investors?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
