Changing to a new policy without adequate disclosure could lead to confusion among retail investors who are less discerning. In contrast, sophisticated hedge funds that understand the history of the practice may exploit this change. To mitigate these risks, I would recommend a more nuanced approach, such as clear disclosures explaining the previous bias and the rationale for the change, rather than abruptly abandoning the bias.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical when it provides transparent and accurate information, while also considering the potential impact on stakeholders. In this context, I would view a policy as ethical if it prioritizes honesty and transparency, even if it means maintaining a historical bias that investors have come to expect. This approach ensures that investors are not misled, but rather, are aware of the potential limitations of the earnings figures. Additionally, the policy should consider the potential consequences on retail investors who may be less informed, and provide adequate disclosures to mitigate any negative effects.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for clarification on how the management team plans to address the potential consequences of changing the policy and provide adequate disclosures to retail investors.
