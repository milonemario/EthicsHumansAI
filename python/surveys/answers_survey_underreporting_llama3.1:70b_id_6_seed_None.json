Although the current policy has been consistent, it still involves intentionally under-reporting earnings, which could be perceived as misleading. Switching to an unbiased reporting policy aligns with ethical standards and may reduce the risk of legal liability or Securities and Exchange Commission investigations. Additionally, adopting this new policy demonstrates a commitment to truthfulness and fairness in financial disclosure, which is essential for building trust with investors and maintaining a positive reputation for the company.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, honest, and unbiased. This means that financial information should be presented in a clear and accurate manner, without intentional omissions or manipulations. The policy should also be consistent and free from deceitful intentions, ensuring that all stakeholders have access to the same information. Furthermore, considerations such as investor protection, regulatory compliance, and corporate social responsibility are essential in evaluating the ethics of a reporting policy. Ultimately, an ethical policy promotes trust, fairness, and accountability, which are vital for maintaining a company's reputation and fostering long-term success.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions.
