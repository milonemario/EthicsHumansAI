The new bias-free policy aligns with transparency and honesty in financial reporting, crucial factors in maintaining investor trust. In addition, educating investors on the change may help mitigate potential disadvantages to retail investors and protect them from being taken advantage of by more sophisticated groups. A public announcement about the transition to a new reporting policy and its benefits should be made swiftly.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and truthfulness towards both shareholders and regulatory bodies. By accurately disclosing financial information, the company can build long-term trust and credibility. In this case, the current policy is unethical as it misrepresents the true earnings per share, even though investors may already adjust their calculations accordingly. Considering the CFO's concerns regarding investor relations and retail investor protection, it would be essential to develop a communication strategy that effectively explains the change in reporting policy, clarifies the reasons behind it, and addresses any potential negative impacts on retail investors. By doing so, the company can minimize confusion and ensure compliance with regulatory standards while maintaining fairness for all stakeholders.", "e6": "In light of the CFO's concerns, I would recommend asking for a detailed analysis of the potential financial impact on both retail and institutional investors if the company were to switch to the new policy. Additionally, understanding the timeline for when new equity will be raised could indicate whether waiting for the next financing round might alleviate some investor relations challenges. Moreover, I would seek insights into possible remedies or strategies to educate retail investors about the change in reporting policy and minimize potential disadvantages for these shareholders compared to sophisticated groups.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
