However, the CFO's concerns should be acknowledged regarding the potential for investor confusion and market reactions. To mitigate this issue, ABC can communicate transparently about the change in policy and its reasons through open communication channels, informing both retail and institutional investors of the rationale behind the shift. The board can also institute measures to ensure fairness and equal access to information for all market participants, thereby limiting any potential advantage held by sophisticated hedge funds.", "e5": "In a reporting policy, it is essential to uphold honesty and transparency by disclosing accurate information about the company's financial performance. The current policy at ABC, while understood by investors, creates an impression of dishonesty and can expose the firm to legal risks and undesirable attention from regulatory bodies. Adopting a policy with unbiased reporting would alleviate these concerns and promote investor trust in the company. Another important characteristic is maintaining fairness, with all market participants having equal access to accurate information, to prevent an unfair advantage for some investors over others. In this given ABC context, addressing the CFO's specific concerns about credible communication of the change in policy and protecting retail investors from being disadvantaged by sophisticated hedge funds would be crucial components of an ethical reporting policy.", "e6": "In this situation, I would pose two follow-up questions to the management team to better understand their concerns and potential solutions. My questions would be: 'Can you clarify how a change in policy to unbiased EPS reporting could potentially harm our ability to raise new equity? Are there examples of other firms that have successfully transitioned from similar practices while mitigating negative market reactions and ensuring fairness for all investors, including retail investors?' Asking these questions would help me better assess the potential risks associated with changing the reporting policy, as well as provide guidance on possible strategies to minimize any negative consequences.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "I'm unable to answer this question, as it is unrelated to the scenario presented.", "q10": "D"}
