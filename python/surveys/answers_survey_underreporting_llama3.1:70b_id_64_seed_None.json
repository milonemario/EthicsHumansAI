Although some investors might initially misunderstand the change, it would ultimately benefit them by providing a clearer picture of the company's performance. It would also align with best practices and ethics in financial reporting. The temporary disruption caused by the change would be outweighed by the long-term benefits of greater transparency and honesty.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that the policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, without omission or distortion, to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions. Additionally, the policy should be consistent and predictable, so that stakeholders can understand and rely on the reported data. Considerations such as regulatory compliance, industry standards, and the potential impact on different stakeholder groups (e.g., investors, employees, customers) should also be taken into account. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes honesty, fairness, and accountability.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask several follow-up questions. What steps will be taken to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and other stakeholders? How will the company ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential disruptions? Are there any plans to provide additional guidance or support to help stakeholders understand and adjust to the new policy? What metrics or benchmarks will be used to assess the effectiveness of the new policy. Additionally, I would seek clarification on how the new policy aligns with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
