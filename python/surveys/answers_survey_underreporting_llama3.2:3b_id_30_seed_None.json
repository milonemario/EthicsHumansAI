The current approach allows all investors to make informed decisions by accounting for the expected bias. Changing now could create unfair market opportunities and harm retail investors, while potentially benefiting only a select few with advanced knowledge of the adjustment needed.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical when it provides transparency and allows investors to make informed decisions, without unduly influencing their judgments. It should avoid misleading or deceiving investors, and provide clear guidance on any adjustments they need to be made. The policy should also consider the needs of all stakeholders, including retail and sophisticated investors. Furthermore, it should be free from self-interest and biases that could compromise its integrity, prioritizing honesty and fairness over short-term gains.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask how the company plans to communicate the adjustment for the expected bias to retail investors, and what additional measures they will take to ensure their needs are being considered in this policy change. Additionally, I would seek clarification on how the benefits of removing the transparent bias were determined and whether any alternative models or approaches have been explored to address the concerns about market opportunities.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 CQ1", "q10": "B"}
