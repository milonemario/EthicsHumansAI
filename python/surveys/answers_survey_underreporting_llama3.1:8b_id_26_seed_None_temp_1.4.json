This risk outweighs any benefit of increased transparency, and our investor relations team may struggle to communicate the changes effectively. Additionally, more sophisticated investors will likely exploit the change for their own advantage at the expense of retail investors.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and consistent in its presentation of actual numbers. This means no biasing or inflating data to achieve a specific outcome. In the context of publicly-traded companies like ABC, accountability to investors should take priority, even if it means facing potential short-term consequences or scrutiny from regulators. Above all, policy decisions should prioritize integrity and fairness, avoiding any practices that could undermine trust between corporations and their stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask for a cost-benefit analysis or impact assessment of the proposed policy change, including specific details on how they plan to effectively communicate the switch to investors and mitigate potential market disruptions. I'd also want to know more about their strategy for dealing with sophisticated traders versus retail investors, and what measures will be in place to ensure fair treatment of all stakeholders.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 5, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 1}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
