Maintaining transparency and integrity builds long-term trust with investors, ultimately benefiting the company more than short-term gains achieved through manipulative accounting practices. The risk of some investors misinterpreting unbiased results is a preferable situation to the deliberate misleading of investors through bias.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents a fair and unbiased representation of the company's financial performance, avoiding any deliberate manipulation or distortion of information.  It also considers the needs of all investors, aiming for clarity and accessibility, while acknowledging the potential for varying levels of investor sophistication.  Materiality and potential impact on decision-making are key considerations.  Finally, the policy must comply with all relevant accounting standards and regulations.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market reaction to the policy change.
