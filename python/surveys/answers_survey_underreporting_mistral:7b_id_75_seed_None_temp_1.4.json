The Board must demonstrate moral and financial integrity when making decision and avoid bias in the financial reporting for the entire investor base. By implementing the new policy with unbiased earnings, a more credible, responsible, and honest image can be gained. To help combat investor confusion, targeted campaigns could be employed to share important information to all investors about the new policy and impact of any potential bias.
