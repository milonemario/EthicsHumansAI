While there may be adjustments and short-term consequences, such actions are long overdue. Enhancing trust and ensuring investor protection should be a top priority in board discussions about earnings reporting.", "e5": "Ethics and financial reporting involve truth, fairness, transparency, accountability, and compliance. Transparent and accurate earnings provide better information that helps investors make informed decisions while strengthening trust with retail and institutional investors. The existing practice of biased reporting may put the company at legal risk, expose it to negative reputation impact, and negatively affect smaller retail investors through unequal information access. For an ethical reporting policy, we need to communicate changes in a clear and appropriate manner ensuring informed decisions from retail and sophisticated hedge funds alike. To that end, the board should seriously consider changing to unbiased reporting as it is more in line with legal expectations and promotes long-term relationships with all shareholders based on mutual trust and transparency.", "e6": "Given a potential bias in current reporting policy that needs rectification, I highly recommend posing questions to the management team regarding their concerns about transparency and shareholder protection. Specifically delving into the possible adverse impacts of the two alternative accounting methods on small retail investors and hedge funds may help identify solutions ensuring fair access to relevant information while preserving confidence and trust with the wider community of stakeholders.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 5, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamaruna'b", "q10": "C"}
