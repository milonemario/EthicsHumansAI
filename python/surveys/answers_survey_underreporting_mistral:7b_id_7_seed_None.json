While the CFO's concerns about communicating the change and market reaction are valid, it is crucial for the board to prioritize ethical considerations and take a stance against deceptive practices. Additionally, the board can reassure retail investors of their continued commitment to financial transparency and fair treatment by providing clear communication and education on the change in policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would prioritize transparency, consistency, and fairness to all stakeholders. It should aim to provide accurate financial information that reflects the true performance of the company over time without intentionally misleading investors. Relevant considerations in this context include ensuring that all investors understand changes in reporting policies and avoiding any potential for harm to small or unsophisticated investors. The CFO's concerns about negative earnings surprises, market reaction, and the competitive advantage of sophisticated investors are factors to be acknowledged but should not be allowed to undermine ethical considerations for fair and transparent financial reporting.", "e6": "While it is understandable that the CFO expresses concerns about negative earnings surprises and the potential impact on retail investors, it seems crucial to ensure that ABC company adopts an ethical policy for financial reporting. These concerns should not overshadow the importance of being transparent and honest in the company's interactions with stakeholders. In light of the potential legal liability and investigation risk associated with the current practice, I would have questions regarding the board's strategic plan to phase out the bias in earnings reports while implementing clear communication to all investors about the change. It is important to consider how investor relations can be made more accessible for retail investors during this transition and ensure that these small investors are not disadvantaged compared to sophisticated hedge funds.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "D", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
