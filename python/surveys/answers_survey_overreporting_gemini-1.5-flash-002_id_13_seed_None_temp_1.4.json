The new policy promotes transparency and long-term investor trust, even if it risks short-term market volatility. Building credibility through honest reporting is crucial for sustainable growth. While some sophisticated investors might exploit the transition, the long-term benefits of ethical behavior outweigh this risk.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and fairness.  It ensures all material information is disclosed truthfully, without manipulation or bias.  It should be understandable to a reasonably informed investor, avoiding complex jargon or intentional obfuscation.  Contextual factors like industry norms and investor sophistication are relevant but shouldn't justify dishonesty or misleading practices.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific methods used to bias earnings under the old policy, and the plan for communicating the change in policy to investors, including specific actions to mitigate any negative market reactions and ensure all investor groups are treated fairly.  I'd also want to understand their assessment of the potential short-term impact and have a plan to address the temporary risk. Finally, I would request a detailed analysis of the potential impact on different investor groups.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
