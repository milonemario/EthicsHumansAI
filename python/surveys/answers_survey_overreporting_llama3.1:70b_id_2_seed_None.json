Although there may be a short-term market reaction, it is essential to prioritize integrity and accuracy in financial statements. This change can also help build trust with investors and reduce the risk of legal liability or regulatory issues. Effective communication from the investor relations team can mitigate potential negative reactions, and the benefits of unbiased reporting will likely outweigh any temporary drawbacks.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that financial reports should clearly and truthfully reflect the company's performance without any intentional manipulation or omission of information. Transparency also involves providing sufficient context and explanations to help stakeholders understand the numbers. Furthermore, I consider it essential for companies to avoid creating confusion or mistrust among investors by maintaining consistency in their reporting methods and disclosing changes to these methods promptly and clearly. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy prioritizes honesty and fairness over short-term gains or expediency.", "e6": "I would have several follow-up questions. What specific steps will be taken to communicate the change in policy to investors and analysts? How will the company ensure that all stakeholders, including retail investors, are aware of the change and understand its implications? What is the expected timeline for implementing the new policy, and how will progress be monitored? Additionally, I would like to know what measures the management team plans to take to mitigate any potential short-term negative market reaction.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
