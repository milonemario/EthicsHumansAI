This could disproportionately harm retail investors who follow the adjusted earnings reports. In contrast, the current policy allows investor relations to manage expectations and mitigate this risk. While there is a potential for legal liability with the current policy, I prioritize protecting retail investors over seeking to attract sophisticated hedge funds.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical if it prioritizes transparency, honesty, and accountability. It should provide clear disclosures that enable investors to make informed decisions, without misleading or deceiving them. The policy should also consider the needs of all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be disproportionately affected by changes in earnings reports. Additionally, the policy should adhere to relevant regulations and standards, such as those set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Finally, the policy should demonstrate a commitment to ongoing evaluation and improvement, with mechanisms in place for monitoring its effectiveness and addressing any unintended consequences.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 1}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "2017 U1N2 (also known as 'Oumuamua')", "q10": "B"}
