Integrity requires respect for investors, employees, partners, and all stakeholders, who should be able to trust in the fair presentation of ABC's financial state. Finally, adhering to legal standards and regulations is crucial to avoiding investigations and protecting the organization from legal liability.", "e6": "To maintain clarity and accountability as board members, I would propose seeking clarification on a few key aspects: (1) The risks associated with continued adherence to the current practice of over-reporting earnings under existing legislation and SEC guidelines.

(2) Given the stated benefits of implementing a no-bias stance in financial reporting, can your IR team identify means for transparent dialogue during the period of transition, effectively dispelling investors' biased adjustments and shedding light on reasons behind the revised policy? (3) Lastly, to prioritize protecting both sophisticated and unsophisticated investors alike, elaborate on potential alternative measures to even any informational differential among them during such a shift in policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 5, "b": 1, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "E", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "The data reveals a complex ethical and practical quandary around ABC's reporting practices for financial gain.
