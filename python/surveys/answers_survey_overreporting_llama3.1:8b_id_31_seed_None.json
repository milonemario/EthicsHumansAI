It should not mislead or deceive stakeholders, even if they are aware of potential biases or omissions. Intentional manipulation or omission of information is inappropriate, even if it's done to achieve a specific goal like raising capital. The policy should also be fair and considerate towards all investor groups, prioritizing their understanding and ability to make informed decisions.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask: What are the potential legal and financial risks associated with maintaining the current biased policy? How will we address the potential harm to small investors if the market does not adjust to the change in reporting policy as expected?
