While the new policy carries a risk of investor misinterpretation, the current policy is inherently deceptive.  The potential reputational damage from continued deception outweighs the short-term risk of the new policy's initial misinterpretation, and the long-term benefits of transparency and ethical conduct are paramount.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy must be transparent, accurate, and consistent.  It should avoid intentional bias or deception, even if a short-term benefit might seem apparent.  The policy should also consider the potential impact on various stakeholder groups (investors, employees, customers), and strive for a balance between providing useful information and avoiding undue harm.  A clear, well-documented process is essential for building trust and demonstrating accountability.", "e6": "Yes.  I would want to understand the specific quantitative measures of potential investor reaction to the new policy change.  What is the projected impact of the change on short-term stock price volatility? What steps will the Investor Relations team take to communicate this policy change proactively and transparently, to mitigate the potential for misinterpretation by investors, particularly retail investors?
