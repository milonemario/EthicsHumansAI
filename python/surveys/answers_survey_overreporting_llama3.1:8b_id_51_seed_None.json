The benefits of transparency do not seem to outweigh these risks for this company at this time.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should clearly disclose all material information, without hiding or misleading investors. Any biases or limitations in the data should be explicitly stated, allowing investors to make informed decisions. The policy should also be consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and avoid unfair or competitive practices that might harm other stakeholders. In this context, the company's well-established and investor-understood policy of consistently over-reporting earnings by 50 cents could be viewed as more ethical than a new policy that may be misunderstood or seen as deceptive.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team.
