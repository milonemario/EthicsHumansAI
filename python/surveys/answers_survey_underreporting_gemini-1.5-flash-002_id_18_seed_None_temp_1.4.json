A transparent, unbiased reporting system builds stronger, long-term investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, unbiased, and consistent. It presents a fair and accurate picture of the company's financial performance without manipulation or intentional obfuscation.  It considers all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be less sophisticated, ensuring that information is readily understandable and accessible.  Furthermore, it should comply with all relevant accounting standards and regulations, avoiding any actions that could be interpreted as misleading or deceptive.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to detail their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, outlining strategies to mitigate potential negative short-term market reactions and to educate all investors on the new reporting approach.
