The CFO's concerns about making the transition without clear communication and mitigating negative reactions from market participants are valid considerations. A more balanced approach might be to gradually phase in the new policy while continuing to provide contextual guidance to investors, rather than abrupt changes that may cause short-term volatility.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would prioritize honesty, transparency, and clarity, avoiding any actions that could deceive or mislead investors. It should also consider stakeholder impact, including retail investors who may be less sophisticated. A policy with built-in adjustments for bias, like the current one, can help manage investor expectations. In contrast, abrupt changes to a new, unbiased policy may cause unnecessary volatility. Ethical policies often weigh competing interests and strive to maintain fairness, even if this means tolerating some level of bias or accommodation for certain groups. Clear disclosure is also paramount.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask additional questions to better understand the proposed change. Specifically, I would like to know more about how the management team plans to communicate the shift to an unbiased policy to retail investors, who may be most affected by the change, and how they intend to mitigate any potential market fluctuations.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Suissefinder)}", "q10": "D"}
