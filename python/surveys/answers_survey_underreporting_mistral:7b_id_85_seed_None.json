Continuing with a bias in earnings reporting is unethical and exposes the company to potential legal liability and harm in the long run. The investor community seems to have adjusted their expectations, but it is essential to be transparent and honest about the firm's financial position. Addressing investor concerns, providing accurate data, and creating trust with all investors should always be a priority.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent and honest in accurately disclosing the company's financial position. The current practice of under-reporting earnings by 50 cents is unethical because it creates an unfair advantage for sophisticated investors. A policy that consistently biases financial reports exposes the company to legal liability and erodes investor trust. To be ethical, a reporting policy must treat all investors fairly and honestly, providing accurate information without bias. As a board member, I would recommend a change to the new policy of unbiased reporting, even if it may cause short-term challenges, to promote long-term success and maintain investor confidence.", "e6": "Based on the scenario provided, it appears that the CFO is more concerned about short-term performance than honest financial reporting. The practice of underreporting earnings may be justified to maintain investor confidence and ensure a steady flow of funds, but it ultimately exposes the firm to unnecessary legal liability and harm over time. I would ask for clarification on the company's long-term strategy and whether the board has considered the potential benefits of transparency and honest financial reporting, which may lead to more sustainable growth in the long run.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "The CFO is expressing concerns about adopting financial transparency to avoid negative earnings surprises in the future and the potential impact on retail investors if they change the current reporting policy.
