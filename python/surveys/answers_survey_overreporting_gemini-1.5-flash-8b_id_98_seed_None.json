Further, I'd want to know the specifics of the investor relations plan for communicating the change and mitigating potential investor concerns, including how the team would address potential trading advantages for sophisticated investors.  Finally, I would inquire about the duration of the equity fundraising, as this timeframe might impact the choice to maintain or change reporting policy.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
