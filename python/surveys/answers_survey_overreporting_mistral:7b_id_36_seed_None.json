The board should take this opportunity to educate investors on the change in financial reporting policy, ensuring that they are not at a disadvantage compared to sophisticated investors.", "e5": "In an ethical reporting policy, transparency and fairness toward all shareholders should be prioritized. The board should aim to report unbiased and accurate earnings that reflect the company's actual financial performance. Although investors may adjust reported earnings downward due to their understanding of the bias, it's still important to maintain an ethical standard to avoid legal liability or scrutiny from regulatory bodies. In addition, the policy should ensure a level playing field for all investors, without giving an unfair advantage to sophisticated ones at the expense of retail investors.", "e6": "To gain a clearer understanding of the situation, it would be important to ask for further details about the current and proposed reporting policies regarding financial reporting and their potential impact on shareholders. I would inquire about the implications of changing the policy for all investors, particularly retail investors, and whether any steps have been considered to minimize the disadvantage they may face compared to sophisticated investors. Additionally, I would seek clarification on the company's communication strategy regarding the change in policy and how it plans to ensure that investors are well-informed about the adjustments needed when considering reported earnings.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by Rosetta spacecraft in 2014", "q10": "D"}
