This means providing stakeholders with timely and comprehensive information that reflects the true financial position of the company. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should be consistent and free from manipulation to achieve short-term gains or mask underlying issues. Considerations such as fairness to all investors, protection of vulnerable stakeholders, and compliance with regulatory requirements are also essential in evaluating the ethics of a reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team.
