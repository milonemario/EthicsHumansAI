With less sophisticated retail investors consistently adjusting reported earnings upward, their trust could be compromised by suddenly shifting to a new no-bias policy and facing short-term disappointment from reduced performance. It is, therefore, recommended that appropriate communication efforts be made to reassure both our current and future shareholders of ABC's commitment to transparent reporting while working diligently towards implementing the change gradually.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should aim for a proper valuation of financial performance and be honest, transparent, accountable, objective, clear to understand by all types of investors, uphold shareholders' interest by maintaining market trust, and consistently communicate changes and future plans in a straightforward manner. The board of ABC must consider the potential impacts their reporting practices have on different investor classes\u2014particularly retail investors\u2014as well as possible regulatory oversight from the SEC due to the current inconsistent practice. In this case, the financial reporting policy should be rethought with attention to minimizing distortions, while taking the CFO\u2019s concerns regarding investors' trust and knowledge into account when making necessary adjustments. Finding a solution that promotes a clear, ethical earnings report would help build credibility while ensuring long-term benefits for all ABC stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I have several follow-up questions for the management team: Firstly, in order to gauge their level of awareness on recent reporting changes among the investor base - Could investors surveyed during interviews differentiate between institutional and retail investors when discussing their adjustments to earnings? Secondly, could they clarify their strategy to promote education about potential biases within these two groups if a change occurs in policy? Thirdly, How does the board plan to minimize short-term market confusion and market volatility surrounding the proposed change? Forth, What specific timelines can the management team propose for the phased implementation and communication of this new unbiased reporting policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 9, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "", "q10": "D"}
