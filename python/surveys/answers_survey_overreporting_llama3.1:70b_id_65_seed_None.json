By presenting unbiased earnings, the company aligns with higher ethical standards, reducing its exposure to regulatory risks and potentially damaging litigation. Although some investors might initially react negatively due to a lack of awareness or understanding of the change, ultimately, this shift will likely enhance the company's reputation and credibility over time.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should provide clear and unbiased information to all stakeholders, free from manipulation or omission of material facts. Consistency in application and clear communication of changes are also crucial. Considerations relevant to the context include avoiding exploitation of less sophisticated investors, minimizing potential harm or surprise to any group, and aligning with regulatory requirements and professional standards. Ultimately, an ethical policy should foster trust and credibility, promoting a level playing field for all stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask: How do you plan to communicate the policy change to investors, analysts, and other stakeholders to minimize potential negative reactions?
