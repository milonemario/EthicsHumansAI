Maintaining an honest and reliable relationship with investors fosters trust and will ultimately benefit the company's reputation and long-term success.  The current practice, while not illegal, erodes this trust. ", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness.  It should present a complete and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any deliberate manipulation or misleading practices.  Consideration should also be given to the potential impact on different investor groups, ensuring no group is unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged.  Materiality of information is also critical; trivial inaccuracies are less problematic than those that significantly influence investor decisions.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market reaction to the policy change.
