Moreover, the potential market advantages for sophisticated hedge funds do not justify maintaining an opaque and biased reporting process. The board should work to address CFO's concerns by communicating clearly the change in policy and its motives while ensuring that retail investors are adequately protected.", "e5": "An ethical financial reporting policy should accurately represent the company's performance and not be biased in any way. In this scenario, considering the investor community understands the 50-cent bias under the current policy, it raises concerns that the true performance may still be misrepresented. To ensure transparency, consistency, fairness to all investors, and compliance with SEC regulations, changing to a new policy without bias is favorable. The board should collaborate with CFO's team to clearly communicate the change in policy, address potential negative outcomes for retail investors while finding methods to level the playing field between sophisticated hedge funds and small investors.", "e6": "The board should ask the CFO about possible methods to address the concerns regarding retail investors, ensuring communication efforts are made to educate and protect them. Moreover, it would be beneficial to inquire whether collaboration can be sought with regulators for guidance on best practices to avoid legal ramifications while adopting a more transparent reporting policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "B", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
