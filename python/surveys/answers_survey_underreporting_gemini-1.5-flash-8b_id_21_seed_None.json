The current policy, despite its ethical shortcomings, has a known impact that allows for a predictable level of investor perception.  Changing to a completely unbiased policy risks a detrimental market impact and possible loss of investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation, whether intentional or through misleading presentation.  Context matters;  a policy must be understandable to investors, and changes should be communicated clearly and in advance, with a rationale.  Finally, the policy must consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, not just the company, recognizing that market volatility can disproportionately harm certain investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for a detailed market analysis of the potential short-term and long-term impact of the policy change on different investor groups (institutional vs. retail), including a specific assessment of how the change in policy would be communicated. I'd also want to know what contingency plans are in place if investor confidence or market reaction turns negative. Lastly, I'd inquire about alternative methods for managing investor expectations regarding future earnings without resorting to bias.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "1I/\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
