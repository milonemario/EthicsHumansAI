Although some investors may initially adjust reported earnings upward by 50 cents out of habit, this is a short-term issue that will dissipate as they become accustomed to the new policy. In the long run, the company's credibility and reputation will benefit from adopting a more transparent and unbiased approach to financial reporting. Additionally, this change can help mitigate potential legal liability related to biased earnings reporting.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, honest, and unbiased. It should provide accurate and complete information to stakeholders, without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. Considerations include consistency in reporting methodology, clear disclosure of any limitations or assumptions, and a commitment to correctness over convenience or short-term gains. In the context of public companies, regulatory compliance and accountability are also essential. Furthermore, an ethical policy should prioritize fairness, avoiding advantages for certain groups of investors at the expense of others. By upholding these principles, a company demonstrates respect for its stakeholders and contributes to maintaining trust in the capital markets.", "e6": "Yes. I would like to ask the management team to provide more information on their plan for communicating the change in policy to investors, analysts, and other stakeholders.
