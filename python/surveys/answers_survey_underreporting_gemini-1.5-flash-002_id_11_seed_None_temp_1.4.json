Maintaining the current policy, even if implicitly understood, is inherently manipulative.  Adopting the new policy fosters greater trust and long-term investor confidence, even if it means navigating initial market volatility.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy. It presents information fairly, avoiding intentional manipulation or bias.  It considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be less sophisticated.  Materiality and the potential for misinterpretation should be considered in choosing the methods of presentation.  Consistent application of accounting standards also ensures fairness.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market impact of switching to the unbiased policy.  I'd also want to understand their plan to communicate this change to investors clearly and proactively, mitigating any misunderstanding or negative perception.
