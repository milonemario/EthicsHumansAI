It should also consider the potential impact on stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers. Ethical policies tend to be consistent, clear, and communicated effectively. Importantly, they acknowledge that reports are not intended for emotional decision-making but rather for informed business decisions. In this case, the original 50-cent bias was a constant, so the policy should adapt to reflect this in a way that minimizes harm to stakeholders while maintaining integrity.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "Against", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 5, "g": 3, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "99942 Apophis (also known as 2004 MN4)", "q10": "B"}
