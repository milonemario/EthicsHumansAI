Although a temporary stock price dip might occur, the shift towards transparency will ultimately benefit the company's reputation and attract investors who value honesty and integrity.

Materiality and compliance with regulations are also vital aspects of ethical financial reporting.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific investor relations strategy to mitigate the short-term market reaction.
