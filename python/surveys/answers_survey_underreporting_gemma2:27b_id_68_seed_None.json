It avoids intentional manipulation or misleading information, even if such practices are widely understood. Ideally, the policy should be clear, readily accessible to all stakeholders, and consistently applied. It should also consider potential consequences for different investor groups and aim to minimize harm while promoting fair access to information.", "e6": "Yes, I would have the following questions for the management team:\n1. What specific steps can be taken to effectively communicate the change in reporting policy to all investors?\n2. What is the estimated short-term financial impact of switching to unbiased reporting, and are there any strategies to mitigate potential negative market reactions?\n3.
