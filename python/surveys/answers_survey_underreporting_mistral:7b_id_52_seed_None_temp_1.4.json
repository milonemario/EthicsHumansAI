Given the context presented in ABC company, I would view ethically sound reporting criteria as follows: maintaining consistency in financial records while staying transparent about any underlying adjustments; communicating clearly and credibly changes in policy through investor relations when necessary; demonstrating sensitivity to market behavioral patterns so as not compromise retail investors, and finally being aware of and adhering to corporate governance principles. Ultimately, it is always crucial to recognize and prioritize ethical integrity above potential short-term performance benefits.", "e6": "While the CFO brings up valid concerns regarding market impact and potential adverse effects to retail investors, it would still be worth probing further before making conclusive decisions.
