In the present situation, changes to the no-bias policy might be considered beneficial for long-term integrity, reducing the associated legal risk and fostering trust between the company and its investors. However, the potential short-term consequences, such as decreased share prices due to increased skepticism or market uncertainty, should also be thoroughly examined and carefully managed.", "e6": "As a board member, it would be prudent to ask more detailed questions regarding the legal risks associated with the current practice and potential investigations or actions by regulatory bodies.
