Although some investors may initially be misled by the change in policy, transparency is essential for building trust and credibility. The potential risks of continuing the current policy, including legal liabilities and regulatory scrutiny, outweigh the potential benefits of maintaining a biased reporting practice. By adopting an unbiased reporting policy, ABC can demonstrate its commitment to integrity and accountability.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should provide stakeholders with reliable information to make informed decisions, without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. The policy should also be consistent in its application, avoiding selective disclosure or manipulation of data. Additionally, the policy should prioritize fairness, treating all stakeholders equally and avoiding favoritism. In the context of financial reporting, this means presenting a true picture of the company's performance, without artificially inflating or deflating earnings. By adopting such a policy, companies can demonstrate their commitment to integrity, accountability, and responsible business practices.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions.
