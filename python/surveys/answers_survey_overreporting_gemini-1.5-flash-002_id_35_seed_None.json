It presents information clearly and avoids manipulation or misleading statements.  It considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors of varying sophistication.  Consistency over time and adherence to accounting standards are also crucial elements of ethical reporting.  The policy should be readily understandable to investors, and if changes are made, the rationale should be communicated clearly.", "e6": "I'd ask about their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, including how they'll address potential concerns and misconceptions.
