Maintaining the current, albeit less ideal, policy seems the prudent course of action until a more favorable market environment emerges or a better communication strategy can be developed for the transition.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors through bias or manipulation, even if maintaining a consistent perception of performance is desired.  Crucially, it considers the impact on all investor classes, not just the sophisticated ones.  The policy should be clearly communicated and understood by all stakeholders, and any change should be proactively disclosed and justified to minimize investor uncertainty and potential market distortions.", "e6": "Yes. I would want to understand the specific market research that suggests a 50-cent downward adjustment in investor perception.  Also, what specific communication strategies are proposed to explain the change in policy to both sophisticated and retail investors, minimizing potential negative market reactions?
