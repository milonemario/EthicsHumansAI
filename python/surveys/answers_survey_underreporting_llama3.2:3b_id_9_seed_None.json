The current under-reporting bias has been a well-known factor that investors can adjust for, whereas the new unbiased approach may be misinterpreted or misunderstood by some investors. This could potentially harm retail investors who are less familiar with financial analysis and may make informed investment decisions based on adjusted earnings. On the other hand, sophisticated hedge funds would likely be aware of this change and trade accordingly, which could lead to uneven market treatment.", "e5": "A reporting policy is viewed as ethical when it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should provide clear, comprehensive, and timely information that enables investors to make informed decisions. The report should not conceal material information or manipulate numerical representations to obscure performance. Additionally, the policy should be consistently applied, avoiding sudden changes that may surprise market participants. Furthermore, it should acknowledge any relevant nuances, risks, or complexities inherent in the reporting, providing a balanced view of the company's financial situation and prospects.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2013 A1 (also known as 'Oumuamua')", "q10": "B"}
