While changing to an unbiased policy may be seen as more ethical, it could lead to market disruptions and potential harm to retail investors. The sophistication of some institutional investors suggests they might adjust for the bias, whereas retail investors would likely suffer. Therefore, I believe continued practice under the current policy is in the best interest of all stakeholders involved.", "e5": "A reporting policy can be considered ethical when it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and consistency. It should provide clear guidance to stakeholders on expectations and limitations, without being deceptive or misleading. In this case, the current policy's consistent bias has become a known quantity, allowing investors to adjust their expectations. An ethical policy would ensure that such biases are clearly disclosed, and any changes are communicated transparently to prevent misunderstandings. Reputability and fairness in financial reporting are key considerations, balancing the need for accuracy with the potential impact on various stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "Against", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 CQ21", "q10": "B"}
