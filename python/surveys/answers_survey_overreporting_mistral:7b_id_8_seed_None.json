Although changing the current policy may negatively impact the stock price in the short term, I firmly believe that adopting a policy of accurate financial reporting without bias is essential for long-term success. The potential legal liability and erosion of investor trust that comes with over-reporting earnings outweigh any initial inconvenience.

Therefore, I recommend adopting the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy requires transparency, accuracy, consistency and fairness. For a policy to be ethical, it must present all necessary information in an understandable way, ensuring that stakeholders can make informed decisions based on the data provided. The policy should not intentionally mislead or bias investors, including through practices like over-reporting earnings. Additionally, the interests of all investors, from retail to sophisticated institutions, must be considered equally and fairly. A no-bias reporting policy eliminates any potential conflicts of interest and promotes fairness across the board. The context here suggests that maintaining a biased policy could disadvantage smaller retail investors by giving an unfair advantage to savvier hedge funds.

To clarify the situation, I would ask: What steps are in place to ensure equal access and treatment for all investors? How does the company plan to mitigate any potential negative impacts on retail investors due to this bias in the reporting policy? Are there any measures taken to protect the interests of less informed or smaller investors? Additionally, it is essential to understand how exactly the market has adjusted earnings downward by 50 cents, and if these adjustments are based on credible research, accurate predictions, or just assumptions. If adjustments rely solely on speculations, it would be beneficial to explore ways to rectify this situation.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 1, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "D", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Interstellar object detected passing through our solar system is Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
