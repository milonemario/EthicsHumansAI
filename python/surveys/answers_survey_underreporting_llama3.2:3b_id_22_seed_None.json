Instead of abolishing the practice of adjusting EPS by 50 cents, the company could consider modifying the policy to make it clear and transparent. For example, this adjustment could be disclosed in footnotes or on a separate page of reports, allowing retail investors to understand the bias while sophisticated investors still benefit from the historical data.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, consistent, and free from material misrepresentation. It should provide all necessary context and clarify any unusual or complex information. The policy should also be accessible to all stakeholders, including retail investors who may not have the same level of sophistication as hedge funds. Additionally, the policy should be accompanied by adequate disclosures and explanations, allowing users to make informed decisions. Finally, the policy should demonstrate a commitment to integrity and accountability, with mechanisms in place to detect and prevent manipulation or deception.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team, specifically related to the potential impact on retail investors and how the company intends to mitigate any potential harm. Some examples include: How will the adjusted EPS be disclosed in a way that is easily understandable by retail investors? What measures will be taken to ensure that sophisticated investors are not disadvantaged by the change? Are there plans to implement additional reporting mechanisms or monitoring systems to prevent abuse of the adjustment policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, followed by the 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) discovery in 2017 and then 2I/Borisov in 2019,  all of which are now widely acknowledged as the first interstellar objects observed within our solar system.", "q10": "D"}
