The new policy, which presents unbiased earnings reports, may lead to incorrect assumptions about the company's performance among some investors, particularly retail investors who may not understand the difference. This could result in a loss of investor confidence and negatively impact the company's stock price and reputation.", "e5": "A morally sound reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and contextually informed. It should avoid misleading or deceiving investors by intentionally understating or overstating financial performance. The policy should also consider the potential impact on various investor groups, including retail and sophisticated investors. Moreover, it should promote fairness and inform decision-making. In this case, the current policy's bias is understood by investors and does not mislead them, whereas the new policy may create unintended consequences among vulnerable investors. Clarity, accountability, and a commitment to honesty are essential characteristics of an ethically sound reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes.
