While ethically arguably superior, the potential for a negative market reaction, particularly if retail investors are caught off guard, outweighs the benefits.  A phased approach, perhaps accompanied by investor communications, would be needed to mitigate these risks and ensure a smooth transition.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deception, even if unintended.  Materiality, the significance of information, and investor sophistication are crucial considerations.
