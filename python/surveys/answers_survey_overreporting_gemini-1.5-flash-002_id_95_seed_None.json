Although a short-term stock price dip is possible due to investor misinterpretations, the long-term benefits of transparency and accurate reporting outweigh the risks.  The current policy, while predictable, is inherently unethical.  The new policy establishes a foundation of trust and allows the company to build its reputation for accuracy and transparency.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy above all else. It presents information fairly, without manipulation or intentional bias.  It should be understandable to a reasonable investor, and the company should proactively address potential misunderstandings.  While considering market reactions, the focus should remain on truthful and complete disclosure, even if that results in short-term negative consequences.  The long-term value of trust outweighs short-term gains from manipulation.", "e6": "I would ask about the specifics of their investor relations plan to communicate the policy change and mitigate potential negative market reactions.
