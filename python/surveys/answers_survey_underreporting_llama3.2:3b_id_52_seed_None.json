While transparency is important, the market has already factored in the adjustment, and changing now would risk negatively impacting retail investors who rely on it as a reliable guide. The existing policy may be imperfect, but it provides a clear understanding of the company's financial performance. A more nuanced approach, such as gradual phase-out of the adjustment or education for investors, could allow for a smoother transition while minimizing disruptions to markets.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical when it prioritizes honesty, transparency, and fairness. It should not mislead investors or conceal important information. Ideally, a policy would provide a clear understanding of the company's financial performance without relying on bias adjustments that confuse investors. Considerations like accountability, compliance with regulations, and stakeholder protection are also essential. A policy should support informed decision-making by facilitating access to accurate data and avoiding potential manipulation or gaming. By prioritizing these principles, reporting policies can maintain trust with investors and contribute to a healthy market ecosystem.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 1}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Siding Spring), also known as PanSTARRS", "q10": "B"}
