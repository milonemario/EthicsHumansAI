The market may initially present volatility, but with clear, consistent communication about the new policy and the rationale for its implementation, investors would eventually reevaluate ABC's value based on unbiased reporting for better, long-term results.", "e5": "Ethical reporting policies, while meeting financial obligations and goals of the company, should reflect honesty, integrity, and fairness for all shareholders. Here are some ethical considerations: (1) Transparency by accurately showing earnings per share without systematic bias to promote informed decisions. (2) Fostering investor trust through timely disclosure, consistent reporting, clear communications about changes in policies, and considering the implications on all types of investors, including small or retail ones. A policy with no-bias reduces potential harm from biased data manipulation leading to false market valuations and potentially illegal practices. (3) Adhering to corporate governance principles, complying with relevant laws and regulations set forth by securities entities, and addressing potential shortcomings in the current reporting practices.", "e6": "Yes, it would be valuable to ask additional follow-up questions from management when addressing concerns about bias in earnings reporting. Some questions could include (i) How do internal measures or indicators that provide unbiased EPS compare with the financial ratios calculated based on reported, biased EPS (e.g., ROA, Return on Equity)? (ii) Given past statements and consistency of earnings data over a longer period of time, can any additional investigations reveal signs pointing towards manipulation of earnings for competitive reasons or to boost the stock price when prior management was in office?  (iii) What measures are the Company committing itself to ensure that there is full compliance with all guidelines from the SEC, and how long will it take before an adjustment like the one being proposed under the new policy might be made?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "While it is interesting, the question posed did not pertain to the first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system.", "q10": "D"}
