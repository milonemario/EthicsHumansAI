The potential for short-term market backlash and disadvantage to retail investors, outweighs the potential long-term benefits.  The current policy, despite its less-than-ideal ethical standing, is a known quantity that maintains investor confidence.  A change could negatively impact the stock price and hurt the company's reputation in the near term, possibly outweighing any long-term gains of increased transparency.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors, whether intentionally or unintentionally.  Crucially, it considers the impact on all stakeholders \u2013 not just sophisticated investors \u2013 and avoids policies that could create an unfair advantage for some over others.  A robust policy also factors in the potential consequences of changing a previously established practice, which should be communicated clearly and thoughtfully to all parties.", "e6": "Yes.  I would want to understand the specific quantitative and qualitative analyses supporting the CFO's concerns about investor reactions to the policy change.  Further, what are the projected short-term negative impacts (stock price drop, investor relations concerns), and what mitigation strategies are planned to minimize this?  Also, what is the specific plan for communicating the policy change to retail investors, and how will they be protected from potential disadvantage compared to sophisticated investors?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
