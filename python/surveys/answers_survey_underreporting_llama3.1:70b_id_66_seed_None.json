Although there may be short-term consequences, such as market reactions or confusion among some investors, the long-term benefits of adopting an unbiased reporting policy outweigh these concerns. This change will also align the company's financial reporting practices with its values and promote a culture of integrity and transparency.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It should provide stakeholders with a clear and unbiased understanding of the company's financial situation. The policy should be consistent, reliable, and free from manipulation or selective disclosure. Furthermore, it should consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may not have access to the same information as institutional investors. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy promotes trust, accountability, and long-term sustainability.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. How do they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and other stakeholders? What steps will they take to educate retail investors about the new policy? Are there any plans to provide additional disclosures or guidance to help investors understand the impact of the change? How will they monitor and address potential market reactions or concerns from investors?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
