The current policy's bias is well-known and anticipated by most investors, who adjust earnings expectations accordingly. In contrast, the new policy may lead to uninformed assumptions and unintended negative consequences for retail investors who are not familiar with the historical context of the bias. A more nuanced approach, such as a clear disclosure of the change in reporting practices, would be a better way to balance transparency with caution.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and non-misleading. It should provide stakeholders with accurate information about the company's financial performance. Ethical reporting policies prioritize clarity over convenience, avoiding biases that may confuse or mislead investors. Considerations such as stakeholder interests, regulatory requirements, and industry standards also come into play. Moreover, ethical reporting policies prioritize long-term trust-building over short-term gains or convenience. By being forthright and transparent, companies build credibility with their stakeholders, which is essential for sustained success in the market.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about specific plans in place to address any potential negative consequences for retail investors who may be unaware of the historical bias. Additionally, I would seek clarification on how the management team intends to communicate changes to the reporting policy to stakeholders and ensure a smooth transition. This could include providing clear guidance on what metrics to use or how to interpret financial statements during this period of change.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 5, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
