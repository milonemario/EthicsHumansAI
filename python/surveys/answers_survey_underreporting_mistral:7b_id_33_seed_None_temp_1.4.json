Key characteristics include transparency, full disclosure of important information so both small and sophisticated investors may make informed decisions based on the same set of facts, and minimization of deceptive practices which create any unfair advantage. It is crucial that investors be served with truthful financial reports, and legal complications or market inequality resulting from bias and inaccuracy must always be recognized and avoided.", "e6": "The following questions provide clarity for understanding management's perspective and implications on potential course of action: How will market perceive the change to a new, bias-free policy regarding earnings per share if management refuses to implement transparency measures or publicly communicate adjustments?
