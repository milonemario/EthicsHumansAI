The short-term market rewards and longer-term penalties, as well as the potential negative impact on smaller investors, make the risk of implementing the new policy too significant.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and accuracy.  It must clearly communicate its methodology, avoiding misleading or manipulative practices.
