Long-term investor trust and a reputation for transparency are more valuable than potentially misleading, biased earnings.  The fact that some investors might misunderstand is a risk worth taking to maintain an ethical approach and avoid the long-term reputational damage associated with a deceptive earnings policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any intentional manipulation or deception, even if some investors might misinterpret it.  Full disclosure, clear communication, and consistent application of accounting principles are crucial.  The policy must stand up to scrutiny and be defensible in the long run, rather than merely addressing immediate market pressures.  Context matters; a policy should be suitable to the company's stage and investors' sophistication levels, with clear communication of any changes.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about the specific investor base and their understanding of financial reporting.
