This outcome is likely to be more detrimental to these smaller investors than the implicit deception of the current policy, in which they are aware of and adjust for the bias themselves.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should ensure transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should not involve overt or implicit deception, and investors should be clearly informed about any adjustments to reported earnings. The policy should also protect the interests of all stakeholders, including smaller investors who may rely on reported numbers for investment decisions. In the context of a publicly traded company, this means prioritizing accuracy over potential short-term gains from biased reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide specific data on how changing to the new policy would impact smaller investors, such as a detailed analysis of their investment behavior and potential losses.
