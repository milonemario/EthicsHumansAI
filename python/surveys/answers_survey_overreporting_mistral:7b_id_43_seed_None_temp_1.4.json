Adopting an unbiased reporting standard is necessary for the reputation and overall financial health of ABJC and its stakeholders.", "e5": " An ethical reporting policy should accurately disclose a firm's financial performance, prioritizing accountability to stakeholders instead of benefiting select investors. The interests of employees, customers, suppliers, and other constituents must also factor into making choices about policies that have broad implications for the company's reputation. Therefore, discontinuing practices with unfair advantages for specific investor groups should be given emphasis, as ABJC needs to strive toward transparency.", "e6": "To ensure that all company stakeholders are considered and protected, it would be beneficial to challenge this view of only prioritizing market expectations. The follow-up questions for the management team may include: - Could any potential consequences from not addressing accounting issues with bias affect the long-term reputation and wellbeing of ABC Company as a whole given recent calls for stronger ethics among businesses? - Have any ethical guidelines been established regarding conflicts between fiduciary duties to stakeholders, and considerations based solely on investor sentiment?
