The current policy, while seemingly transparent to some, inherently introduces bias, potentially undermining investor trust in the long run.  A phased implementation and transparent communication of the change to investors would mitigate the potential negative impact.  Therefore, despite the risk, the ethical imperative and long-term investor relations benefits favor a switch to the new policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency and truthfulness.

Consideration of the potential impact on all investor classes, including retail investors, is vital.  Finally, the policy should be disclosed clearly and consistently, minimizing ambiguity and investor confusion.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask for a detailed risk assessment outlining the potential negative impact on share price, investor confidence, and retail investor sentiment from switching to the new policy.  I'd also want to know the specific plan for communicating the policy change to investors, including the phased rollout strategy and anticipated investor reactions.
