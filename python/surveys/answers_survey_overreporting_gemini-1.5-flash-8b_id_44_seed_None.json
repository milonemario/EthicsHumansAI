While the current policy may have served a short-term strategic purpose, maintaining a transparent approach fosters trust and long-term investor confidence, which outweighs the immediate market reaction risks.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should clearly and completely disclose all material information, avoiding any form of manipulation or deception, even if seemingly advantageous in the short term.

Lastly, policies should be consistently applied and not be dependent on market conditions.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask for a detailed breakdown of the potential negative market reaction to the new policy, including specific scenarios and predicted durations.
