Although some investors may initially be misled, this is a temporary issue that can be addressed through clear communication of the policy change. In contrast, continuing with the current biased reporting practice could expose the company to legal liability or regulatory scrutiny. By adopting an unbiased approach, the company demonstrates its commitment to integrity and builds trust with investors, which is essential for long-term success.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. This means providing complete and unbiased information that allows stakeholders to make informed decisions. In the context of financial reporting, this includes avoiding practices like intentional rounding or smoothing of numbers that can mislead investors. Additionally, companies should consider the potential impact of their reporting policies on all stakeholders, including small investors who may not have access to the same level of information as institutional investors. Consistency and clear communication are also crucial in maintaining trust and credibility.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team.
