Changing to a unbiased reporting policy could lead to investor surprise and potentially negative consequences for retail investors who may miss the adjusted earnings that have become expected by some sophisticated investors.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, honest, and unbiased. It should provide investors with accurate and complete information to make informed decisions. In this case, changing to a new policy without bias may seem like a good idea, but the CFO's concerns about potential harm to retail investors who rely on the adjusted earnings highlight an important consideration: fairness and equal access to information for all types of investors. An ethical policy should balance these competing interests.", "e6": "Yes.
