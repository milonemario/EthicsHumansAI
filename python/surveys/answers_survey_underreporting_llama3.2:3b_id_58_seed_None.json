Sophisticated investors like hedge funds will adjust for the bias anyway, but small investors might be unfairly affected. The CFO's concerns about the impact on investor relations and retail investors' expectations also warrant careful consideration before making such a drastic change.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical when it provides investors with accurate and comprehensive information to make informed decisions, without deceiving or misleading them. Transparency and consistency are crucial. In the case of earnings reporting, a policy that adjusts for biases or complexities in revenue recognition should be clearly disclosed and accounted for in financial disclosures. The policy should also ensure that all stakeholders, including retail investors, receive consistent and comparable information. Additionally, any adjustments or deductions made from reported earnings should be transparently explained to maintain trust and fairness among investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask additional questions to clarify the potential impact on investor confidence and relationships. Specifically, what steps are being taken to reassure retail investors that they will continue to receive adjusted EPS figures, and how will this change be communicated effectively?
