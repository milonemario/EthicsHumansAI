The CFO's concerns about investor relations and potential market rewards against small investors are valid considerations. However, as a board member, I would prioritize protecting retail investors and ensure that any change to the policy is thoroughly thought through and communicated effectively to all stakeholders.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as transparent, honest, and free from manipulation. It should not mislead or deceive investors, but rather provide a clear and accurate picture of the company's financial performance. Additionally, the policy should be in line with relevant accounting standards and regulatory requirements. In this context, transparency and accountability for any inaccuracies are essential considerations. A reporting policy that prioritizes the interests of retail investors while also being mindful of market dynamics and stakeholder expectations would be considered most ethical.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team regarding the potential implementation of the new policy. Specifically, I would ask about the contingency plans in place to mitigate any market disruption or adverse reactions from retail investors, and how they will ensure that all stakeholders are adequately informed and prepared for the change. Additionally, I would inquire about the timeline and phased rollout of the new policy to minimize its impact on the company's operations and financial performance.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 1, "d": 3, "e": 1, "f": 5, "g": 2, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2013 A1/ (p/2013 R5) / CNEOS - Comet/PANSTARRS-20120611-01001101X N/A 7km 7m 7 AU 0.016 AU 21.1 AU March 13, 2013", "q10": "B"}
