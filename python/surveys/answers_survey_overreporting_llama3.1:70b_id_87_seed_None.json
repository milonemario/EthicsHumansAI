Ultimately, adopting the new policy is a responsible step towards more accurate and trustworthy financial disclosures.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It should provide stakeholders with timely, complete, and unbiased information, enabling informed decision-making. The policy should also consider the needs of diverse stakeholders, including small investors who may not have equal access to information or resources. Furthermore, it should be consistent with laws and regulations, and take into account any potential consequences for the company's reputation and social responsibility. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy balances the interests of various stakeholders while upholding the values of integrity and fairness.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions.
