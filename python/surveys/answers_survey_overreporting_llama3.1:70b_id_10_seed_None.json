Although there may be short-term market volatility, the benefits of unbiased reporting outweigh the potential costs. The current policy's bias may lead to regulatory scrutiny and legal liability, whereas the new policy promotes integrity and credibility in the company's financial reporting. Furthermore, it levels the playing field for all investors, ensuring that no group has an unfair advantage due to privileged information.", "e5": "I consider a reporting policy ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that financial information should be presented in a clear and timely manner, without any intentional manipulation or omission of facts. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize fairness, ensuring that all stakeholders have equal access to information and are not misled by the company's disclosures. In the context of ABC, I also consider it important for the reporting policy to be consistent with regulatory requirements and industry best practices, while balancing the need for transparency with the potential impact on investors and market perceptions.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions.
