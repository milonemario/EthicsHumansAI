The over-reported earnings per share (EPS) are misleading and could negatively impact investors if left unchanged. Changing to a new policy without bias would provide accurate financial reporting, promote investor trust, and reduce the risk of costly litigation or penalties. While the CFO's concern about market reactions is valid, investors are sophisticated enough to understand and adjust for the company's consistent earnings bias. Addressing this issue proactively would be beneficial for both retail and institutional investors in the long run.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should provide transparency, accuracy, and fairness when presenting financial information to investors. Such a policy would uphold integrity and credibility by accurately representing the firm's performance without bias or manipulation. Relevant considerations include complying with regulatory requirements and industry standards to ensure investor protection, fostering trust in the company among retail and institutional investors alike, and promoting equality in access to information for all shareholders regardless of investment experience or sophistication.", "e6": "In light of the CFO's concerns, it would be valuable to explore potential risks and consequences of maintaining the current policy and implementing the no-bias policy. Key questions to ask might include: Are there alternatives to raising new equity without biased earnings being a hindrance? What measures can be taken to ensure fairness, minimize information asymmetries, and protect retail investors in the shift to the new reporting policy? How would a potential change impact future financial forecasts or projections? Is legal counsel confident that no investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission would ensue from this consistent bias in earnings reports?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "The question is about the ethical dilemma of over-reporting earnings, rather than the detection of interstellar objects.
