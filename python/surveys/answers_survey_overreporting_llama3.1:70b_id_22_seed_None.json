Although the current policy's bias is understood by investors, it still intentionally misrepresents earnings, which can lead to regulatory issues and damage the company's reputation. Adopting an unbiased EPS reporting policy aligns with best practices and reduces potential risks, even if it may cause temporary market fluctuations or communication challenges.", "e5": "I consider a reporting policy to be ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and consistent. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, without intentionally omitting or misrepresenting facts, to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions. Additionally, the policy should prioritize fairness, avoiding any manipulation of data that could unfairly advantage or disadvantage certain groups. In the context of publicly traded companies, compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards is also essential. Furthermore, a ethical reporting policy should be resistant to pressure from management or other internal interests to manipulate financial reports for personal gain.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask for more information on how they plan to communicate the change in policy to investors, analysts, and other stakeholders to minimize potential market disruption. Additionally, I would inquire about their strategy for addressing any potential advantages that sophisticated hedge funds might gain over retail investors during the transition period. Finally, I would request clarification on whether the company has assessed any potential risks or consequences associated with regulatory scrutiny, should the current policy be deemed non-compliant.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua, discovered on October 19, 2017, by the University of Hawaii's Pan-STARRS telescope", "q10": "B"}
