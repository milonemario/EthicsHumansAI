This could disproportionately affect small investors who rely on the existing bias as a way of evaluating the company's performance. In contrast, sophisticated hedge funds may actually be disadvantaged by the change in policy, as they would no longer have a consistent upward adjustment to apply. These potential negative consequences outweigh the benefits of the new policy and make it undesirable for investors like small retail investors.", "e5": "A reporting policy should aim to provide stakeholders with accurate and transparent information. Ethical considerations include honesty, clarity, and fairness in presentation of financial data, avoiding any material misrepresentation or omission that could impact investment decisions or perpetuate undue confidence in management's version of events. Additionally, the policy should acknowledge any complexities, biases, or uncertainties that may affect the data, providing context and caveats where necessary.
