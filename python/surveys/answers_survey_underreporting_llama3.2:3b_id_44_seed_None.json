Changing the policy may lead to difficulties in explaining the change and could result in higher stock prices initially, followed by a drop as sophisticated investors adjust their expectations. This could ultimately harm retail investors, making me hesitate to recommend changing the policy at this time.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and considerate of its potential impact on all stakeholders. Ethical policies provide clear guidance to avoid misinterpretation, disclose material information promptly, and maintain consistency over time. They also prioritize fairness and equity, avoiding actions that could unfairly advantage or disadvantage certain groups. In this context, the current policy's intention to manage investor expectations while maintaining transparency weighs its potential for benefit against its limitations on financial reporting accuracy. Ethical policies should balance these competing priorities to foster trust and confidence in the reported information.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about potential mitigation strategies to address concerns about retail investors and how to facilitate a smooth transition for them if the policy is changed. Additionally, I would inquire about plans to continue evaluating and adjusting the policy as needed to ensure it remains fair, transparent, and aligned with evolving stakeholder needs.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 4, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "1O-THE-WISSPER-1, also known as 'Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
