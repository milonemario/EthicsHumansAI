Furthermore, sophisticated investors are aware of the current policy, and smaller investors may get hurt by changing, so changing at this time does not seem prudent based on available information.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should clearly and accurately reflect a company's true financial situation, with no intentional misrepresentation or hiding of unfavorable data. It should also be transparent, easy to understand, and in line with publicly available accounting standards and regulations. In the context of publicly traded companies, this means being honest about earnings, revenue, and expenses, even if it makes performance appear less impressive on paper. Moreover, the policy should ensure that smaller or lesser informed investors are not taken advantage of by more sophisticated investors.", "e6": "Yes. I would have a few follow-up questions, such as: 1) What specific metrics or benchmarks do you use to assess investor sophistication and how will we protect smaller investors during the adjustment period? 2) Are there any internal checks or audits that we can implement to ensure compliance with changing regulations prior to actual change occurring within an organization. 3) Is there potential for stockholder unrest if a current system is used?", "e7": "Against", "d1": 2, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 1, "c": 1, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 1}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua (or 1I/2017 U1, which is its officially astronomical name)", "q10": "B"}
