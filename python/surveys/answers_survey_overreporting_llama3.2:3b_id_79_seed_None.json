This could negatively impact small investors who have come to rely on the predicted earnings bias as part of making informed investment decisions. In contrast, sophisticated hedge funds would likely understand the change and trade accordingly, but this might be at the expense of retail investors. As a board member, I prioritize the interests of all shareholders, including those with less expertise.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy would prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should provide clear guidance on what information is presented, how it's presented, and when adjustments are made. The policy should also be accessible to all stakeholders, including non-expert investors. Additionally, it should avoid exploiting common misperceptions or biases, as seen in this case. By doing so, the reporting policy promotes trust, reliability, and informed decision-making among all shareholders, regardless of their investment level.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask several follow-up questions, such as: What support systems or resources are in place for retail investors who need to adjust their expectations downward? How will we verify that sophisticated hedge funds understand the change and adjust their trading strategies accordingly? Moreover, what safeguards will be put in place to prevent any similar biassed reporting practices from recurring in the future?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Borisov)", "q10": "B"}
