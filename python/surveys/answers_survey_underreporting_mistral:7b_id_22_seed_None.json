The market may initially react negatively, but consistent, unbiased earnings figures will build investor trust over time. To mitigate concerns about retail investors being at a disadvantage, the company can make a public announcement explaining the change in policy and provide educational resources to investors regarding their reported earnings.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should accurately reflect the financial state of a company to promote fairness and transparency. This includes consistent, unbiased reporting that complies with regulatory requirements and refrains from practices that could expose the firm to legal liability or mislead investors. While maintaining investor trust is important, it should not come at the expense of honesty and transparency. Considering the CFO's concerns about retail investors, the board should address any potential disadvantages they may face due to a lack of knowledge regarding biased reporting practices. This can be achieved through public disclosure and educational resources focused on maintaining investor trust in the long term.", "e6": "Given the CFO's concerns about legal liability and potential harm to retail investors, it would be beneficial to seek further clarification on the specific risks and challenges associated with changing the current policy. It may also be constructive to discuss alternatives like phasing in the new policy, increasing disclosure of the reported earnings bias, or providing educational resources to retail investors about adjusted earnings. The board could also explore ways to improve communication with investors regarding the change in policy, such as a planned announcement and a dedicated investor relations focus on addressing questions and concerns.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "B", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "<no answer>", "q10": "D"}
