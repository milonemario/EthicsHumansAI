Although there may be short-term market adjustments, adopting an unbiased reporting policy aligns with best practices and reduces the risk of potential legal liability or regulatory issues. Additionally, honest reporting will ultimately lead to a more accurate valuation of the company's stock.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should clearly present financial information without attempting to mislead or deceive stakeholders. Additionally, it's essential to consider the potential impact on various investor groups, such as retail investors who may not have access to the same level of information as sophisticated investors. Consistency and accountability are also crucial in building trust with stakeholders. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize fairness, honesty, and clarity, even if it means facing short-term challenges or adjustments.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to ensure a smooth transition. Specifically, I'd like to know how management plans to communicate the policy change to investors, analysts, and other stakeholders, and what steps will be taken to educate them on the new reporting format. Additionally, I'd ask about potential contingency plans in case of unexpected market reactions or if there are any concerns about temporary stock price volatility. Lastly, I'd inquire about how progress towards the new policy's implementation will be tracked and reported to the board.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (also known as 1I/2017 U1), a small, elongated, and cigar-shaped asteroid or comet that passed within 24 million miles of Earth on October 14, 2017.", "q10": "B"}
