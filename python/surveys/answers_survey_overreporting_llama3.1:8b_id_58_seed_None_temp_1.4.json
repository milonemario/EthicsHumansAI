If the company changes to a new policy without addressing these expectations, the stock price could dip which might outweigh any benefits of being transparent.", "e5": "In my view, an ethical reporting policy would involve truthfulness and transparency. The company's reports should accurately reflect their financials without manipulation or bias. Investors must be given clear explanations for any numerical adjustments made to earnings. Further, stakeholders should not be taken in through subtle cues implying misdirection. If policies change, this too should be communicated clearly to all parties including the reasons behind such changes and any associated implications. Transparency regarding future plans for equity funding might also demonstrate credibility.", "e6": "Yes.
