Although a transition to an unbiased policy might initially create investor confusion, the long-term benefits of ethical, transparent reporting outweigh the short-term risks.  This approach fosters trust and a more sustainable relationship with investors over time, aligning with the company's best long-term interests.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any intentional manipulation of financial data, even if the market anticipates adjustments.  Consideration should be given to the potential impact on different investor groups (e.g., retail vs. institutional) and the long-term consequences for the company's reputation.  Ultimately, the policy should reflect a commitment to truthful and complete financial disclosure.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to understand the specific projections for investor reaction to the new, unbiased policy.  Questions about alternative communication strategies for the transition period (such as investor briefings and detailed financial reports), and how the change aligns with company goals are also necessary.
