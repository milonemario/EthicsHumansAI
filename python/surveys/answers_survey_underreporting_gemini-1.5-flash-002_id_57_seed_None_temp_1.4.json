Furthermore, it must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific methods used to bias earnings under the previous policy, the projected impact of the policy change on investor relations and communications, and a detailed plan for communicating the change to investors and mitigating potential negative short-term market reactions.
