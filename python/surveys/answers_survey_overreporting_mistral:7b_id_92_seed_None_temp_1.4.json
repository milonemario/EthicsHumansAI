As a board member, my recommendation would be to adopt the policy that reports without bias. Although investors might still correct for biased reporting, it aligns better with ethical standards and reduces potential risks of future legal complications. Providing more consistent, transparent information benefits all stakeholders.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy must provide transparent and accurate financial information. The current policy of ABC is not ethical due to its deceptive practice of consistently over-reporting earnings per share. Changing to a new policy without bias would be in line with ethics, as it promotes transparency and facilitates fair trading opportunities for all investors. Investors' best interests should always be prioritized over the convenience of the management team or short-term stock price manipulation.", "e6": "Yes. It may be worth asking about the long-term implications for ABC's shareholders if the existing non-compliance policy with accounting regulations is persisted. I also think it's important to find out why their attempts to modify the reporting policy in previous years were rebuffed and if that had any impact on management compensation over these periods.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "The question does not explicitly provide information to determine the answer about an historical first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system.
