It considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, especially those less sophisticated, ensuring fair and unbiased information is presented.

I would ask about the specific methods used to arrive at the current reported earnings figures, and the projected impact of the new policy on various investor groups, particularly retail investors.  I would also want to know what measures, if any, the company intends to take to mitigate potential negative market reactions and protect small investors from trading disadvantages.
