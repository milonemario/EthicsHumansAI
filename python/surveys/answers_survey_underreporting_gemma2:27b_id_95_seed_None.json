It provides investors with a clear and unbiased view of the company's financial performance.  This means avoiding any intentional manipulation or distortion of figures, even if it's a long-standing practice. Communicating any changes in methodology clearly and thoroughly to all stakeholders is crucial to maintain trust and prevent unintended harm.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team:\n\n1. What specific strategies can we implement to effectively communicate the change in reporting policy to all investors, minimizing potential for misinformation?\n2.  Has legal counsel assessed the legal risks associated with both continuing the current practice and transitioning to a new policy?\n3. Can we quantify the impact of the change on investor expectations and stock performance based on market analysis and historical data?\n4. Are there any alternative solutions, such as phasing out the adjustment gradually or providing additional transparency measures alongside the new policy?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "'Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
