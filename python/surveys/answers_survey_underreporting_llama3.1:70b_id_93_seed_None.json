While there may be short-term costs, such as temporary confusion among some investors, the long-term benefits of honest and unbiased reporting outweigh these concerns. Furthermore, maintaining a biased reporting practice could lead to reputational damage and regulatory risks if discovered.

It should provide stakeholders with a clear and unbiased understanding of the company's financial performance. This means avoiding intentional biases or distortions in reported figures. The policy should also be consistent and reliable over time, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on actual results rather than speculation. Additionally, consideration should be given to the potential impact on different stakeholder groups, including retail investors who may not have equal access to information as more sophisticated market participants.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more information on their plan for communicating the policy change to investors and stakeholders, including how they intend to educate them about the impact of the change.
