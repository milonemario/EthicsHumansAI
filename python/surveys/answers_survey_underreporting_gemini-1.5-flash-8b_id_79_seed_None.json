Maintaining the current policy, despite its inherent deception, seems the more prudent choice in the short term to protect the company's standing and avoid the unpredictable consequences of a policy shift.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should clearly communicate the company's financial performance without intentional manipulation or deception.  Considerations include investor sophistication, the potential impact of policy changes on market perception, and the overall long-term health and reputation of the company.  Crucially, the policy should avoid practices that exploit investor naivet\u00e9 or create unfair advantages for certain groups.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask about the specific investor reaction models used to predict potential negative market reactions. What is the anticipated impact of the new policy on the company's valuation in the medium to long term, as well as the anticipated short-term impact?  What are the specific strategies for communicating the change in policy to investors, including a detailed description of anticipated investor feedback and strategies to address concerns?
