The long-term risks of dishonesty outweigh short-term market volatility.  The new policy fosters transparency and trust, attracting investors who value integrity. While there may be an initial market adjustment, it's a necessary step toward ethical and sustainable business practices.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, providing a fair and complete picture of the company's financial performance.  It avoids manipulation or intentional misrepresentation, regardless of potential market reactions.  It considers all stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the public, ensuring equitable access to information.  Furthermore, it should be consistently applied and easily understood, minimizing potential for confusion or misinterpretation.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific investor relations strategy to mitigate the anticipated negative market reaction to the new policy.  I'd also inquire about a plan to educate retail investors about the change and its positive implications for long-term transparency and trust, and to analyze if specific communication methods (e.g., investor webinars) would help reach those most likely to misinterpret the data.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
