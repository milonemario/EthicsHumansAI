The long-term benefits of transparency and investor trust outweigh the potential for temporary negative market response.  The current practice is arguably deceptive, even if investors anticipate it.  A shift to transparency builds a stronger foundation for long-term investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness.  It presents a complete and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any intentional manipulation or misrepresentation.  It considers the impact on all investor groups, ensuring no group is unfairly disadvantaged.  Materiality is key; omissions or misstatements that could reasonably influence investment decisions should be avoided.  Consistency over time is also essential for reliable analysis.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific mechanisms used to inflate earnings under the current policy, the potential for legal or regulatory repercussions, and a detailed plan to communicate the policy change to investors, addressing the concerns raised regarding the 50-cent adjustment.
