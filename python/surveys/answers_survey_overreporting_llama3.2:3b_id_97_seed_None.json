The potential benefit of the new policy - more accurate reporting - may be outweighed by the risk of harming retail investors who won't adjust for the change. Additionally, the CFO's concerns about investor relations and market reputation seem valid, suggesting a potential increase in scrutiny and penalties for missteps under unbiased reporting. Further consideration is needed to weigh these competing interests before making an informed decision.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and clarity. It should accurately reflect a company's financial situation without intentionally misleading stakeholders. A key consideration is whether the policy aligns with the level of investor sophistication and expected cognitive biases. Transparency also involves acknowledging any deviations from standard reporting practices, as in this case, where the company has long-standing history and widely understood bias. Finally, an ethical policy should consider the broader social impact, such as avoiding unintended harm to vulnerable groups like retail investors who may be disadvantaged by more sophisticated market players.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask follow-up questions to clarify certain points, such as: How do you plan to address concerns from retail investors who may be negatively impacted by the change? What specific actions will be taken to ensure a smoother transition and mitigate any potential harm to these groups? Additionally, how should we approach transparency and disclosure in our reporting going forward, particularly regarding the historical bias?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 1}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "B", "q9": "1O-TOMe, a small asteroid discovered on October 13, 2017, by astronomers at the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona.", "q10": "B"}
