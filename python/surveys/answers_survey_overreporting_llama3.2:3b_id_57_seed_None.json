Retail investors and small investors, who are less attentive to reporting nuances, could be disproportionately harmed by price movements in response to changes in EPS adjustment. In contrast, sophisticated hedge funds would likely adjust for the bias anyway, causing them relatively little harm. As a board member, my primary concern is the company's stakeholders, including retail investors, so I prioritize maintaining the current transparency-based approach to minimize potential negative consequences.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, with clear and concise disclosure of any adjustments or biases. It should also prioritize truthfulness over potential short-term gains, ensuring that investors can make informed decisions based on accurate information. Additionally, the policy should consider the potential impact on different investor groups, particularly retail investors who may not be vigilant about nuances in reporting. By taking a stakeholder-centric approach and prioritizing accuracy, fairness, and transparency, a company can maintain trust and credibility with its investors. This fosters long-term sustainability and ethical business practices.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 5, "c": 5, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 5, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "B", "q9": "2017 UQ}_{5}S_{2}", "q10": "B"}
