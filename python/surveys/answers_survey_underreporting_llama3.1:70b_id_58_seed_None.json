The current policy's bias is well-understood by the investor community, but it still poses a risk of misinterpretation and potential legal liability. Adopting the new policy will eliminate this risk and ensure that the company's financial reports accurately reflect its true performance, ultimately benefiting both the company and its stakeholders in the long run.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. Transparency means clearly disclosing all relevant information, including any changes to the reporting policy. Accuracy ensures that reported figures reflect the company's true financial performance. Unbiased reporting avoids intentionally misleading stakeholders or presenting a distorted view of the company's finances. Additionally, consideration should be given to fairness and equality, ensuring that all stakeholders have equal access to information and are not unfairly disadvantaged by the reporting policy.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team. Specifically, I would ask about their plan to communicate changes in the reporting policy to stakeholders, including investors and analysts.

Additionally, what metrics or benchmarks will be used to measure the impact of the change on financial reporting accuracy and transparency?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "C", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
