While changing practices can be challenging and there may be short-term market turbulences, it is essential for long-term trust and transparency. Investors deserve accurate information, regardless of their sophistication level. To ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential harm to retail investors, communicate the change clearly while emphasizing the reasons behind it.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should align with transparency, fairness, and integrity. It requires accuracy and consistency to ensure that all investors have access to accurate information, regardless of their level of sophistication or the magnitude of their holdings. Hiding the truth through earnings manipulations can lead to unintended consequences, including legal repercussions, loss of investor trust, and reputational damage. A shift towards transparency is essential for cultivating a relationship of mutual trust between the company and its investors. Ultimately, the goal should be to achieve long-term financial success while prioritizing the best interests of all stakeholders.", "e6": "To clarify, I would have a few follow-up questions for the management team. Firstly, could you elaborate on how changing the policy would impact ABC's ability to raise capital in the future and its long-term prospects? Secondly, are there any steps planned to help inform retail investors about the change and provide them with updated financial information that takes into account the absence of the 50-cent adjustment? Lastly, could you share more about efforts to mitigate the potential impact on retail investors when adjusting the reporting policy? Addressing these points will allow the board to make an informed decision while minimizing potential negative consequences for all stakeholders.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "E", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": null, "q10": "D"}
