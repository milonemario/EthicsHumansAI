Although it might cause a temporary dip in stock price due to investor misinterpretations,  the long-term benefits of building trust and maintaining a strong ethical reputation far outweigh this risk.  Maintaining the current deceptive practice is ultimately unsustainable and more damaging in the long run.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and fairness to all stakeholders.  It presents information clearly and without deliberate manipulation, even if it may reveal less favorable results.  It considers the potential impact on different investor groups and avoids practices that create an unfair advantage for some investors over others.  The policy should also be consistently applied over time.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the policy change to investors and mitigate potential negative market reactions.  I would also want to understand the detailed assessment of risks associated with the policy change, including the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny or legal challenges.
