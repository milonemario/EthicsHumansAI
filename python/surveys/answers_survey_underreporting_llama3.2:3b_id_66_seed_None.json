The CFO's concern about market volatility and adverse reactions from investors who struggle to adjust their expectations are valid. Retail investors may be negatively impacted if they fail to anticipate the change in reporting practices, which could lead to a short-term crisis. Therefore, I would recommend proceeding with caution and considering measures to mitigate these potential risks before implementing the new policy.", "e5": "A responsible reporting policy should prioritize honesty and transparency, without misleading investors. It should ensure that financial statements accurately reflect a company's performance and position, and provide stakeholders with relevant information to make informed decisions. Ethical policies also consider the potential impact on different types of investors, including retail and institutional investors, and strive for fairness and consistency. Additionally, policies should be free from conflicts of interest and prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains. Ultimately, a well-designed policy balances the need for transparency with the need to avoid unfairly penalizing or misinformed investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to mitigate potential market disruptions and ensure a smooth transition to the new policy. Specifically, I would like to know their approach for communicating the changes to investors, how they will monitor and address any reactions from retail investors who may be impacted, and what safeguards are in place to prevent unfair advantages or conflicts of interest.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 2, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
