It should provide clear guidance on what information is material and important to investors, avoiding any ambiguities that could be exploited. The policy should also consider the potential impact on various stakeholders, including retail investors who may not fully understand the nuances of the business. Furthermore, it should ensure that management's interests align with those of shareholders, both in the short-term and long-term. Finally, a transparent and communicated policy helps maintain trust and credibility with stakeholders, which is essential for a company's success and reputation.", "e6": "Yes, I have several follow-up questions for the management team regarding their concerns and justifications for changing or maintaining the current policy. These include: Can you provide more information about how you will address and communicate with retail investors who may be negatively impacted by the change?
