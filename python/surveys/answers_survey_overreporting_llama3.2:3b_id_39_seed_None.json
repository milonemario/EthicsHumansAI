Despite being a minor bias, this lack of clarity could harm small-scale and retail investors who might not fully understand the context. The CFO's concerns about market reactions to the change are also valid. As a board member, I would prioritize caution and consider alternative solutions that maintain some level of transparency while mitigating potential risks.", "e5": "A responsible and ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and clarity. It should accurately reflect the company's financial performance without deception or manipulation. Additionally, it should consider the diversity of its investors, including small-scale and retail investors who may not have in-depth knowledge of complex accounting practices. The policy should also take into account the potential impact on the market and maintain a balance between compliance and disclosure. Furthermore, it should be adaptable to changes in the regulatory environment and be subject to ongoing review and revision to ensure its sustainability and integrity.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask a few follow-up questions. First, what steps do you propose to address any potential backlash from investors who may be confused by the change in reporting policy? Additionally, how will you ensure that the company's financial performance is accurately and transparently presented despite the removal of the disclosed bias? Further, are there any plans to review or revise the policy on a regular basis to adjust for changes in the market or regulatory landscape?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 1, "d": 5, "e": 4, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 2}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (PANSTARRS)", "q10": "B"}
