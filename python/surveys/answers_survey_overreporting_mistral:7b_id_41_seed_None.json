The ethical considerations and long-term sustainable growth of the firm are paramount. Although there may be a temporary period of confusion among some investors, it is important to prioritize transparency and trust within our financial reporting. We can mitigate potential negative market reaction by communicating effectively with investors about the policy change and its implications on earnings.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and consistently applied. It should aim to faithfully represent the company's financial performance without bias or misrepresentation. In this case, the current policy is questionable due to its lack of transparency and potential exposure to legal liability. The new policy proposed aims for accuracy but may still need to address concerns about market reaction and fairness, especially towards retail investors, who could be disadvantaged without proper communication and education. It's crucial to find a balance between ethical reporting practices, investor trust, and long-term sustainable growth.", "e6": "It's essential to gather more information about the potential impact of a change in financial reporting policy on different investor groups. For instance, it would be relevant to investigate whether and how the company communicates with its retail investors regarding changes in such policies. Another crucial aspect is assessing if there are any alternative ways to maintain stock prices while shifting toward a more ethical reporting standard. Lastly, I'd want to know more about potential strategies to minimize the perceived market disadvantage against small investors when moving away from the current policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "A", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "No interstellar object was mentioned in this passage.", "q10": "D"}
