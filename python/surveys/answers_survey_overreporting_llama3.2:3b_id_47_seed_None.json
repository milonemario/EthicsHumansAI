If implemented carefully, including transparent communication and education for investors, the benefits of increased accuracy could outweigh potential short-term disruption. However, due to the possibility of market reaction against the company and its investors, I would recommend further consideration and evaluation before making a final decision.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, honest, and minimizes harm to stakeholders. Transparency would include clear disclosure of all relevant information, including any biases or adjustments. Honesty means avoiding deception and misrepresentation. In this case, the current policy's known bias allows investors to make informed decisions, while still being deceived about the true earnings. The new policy would shift from honest (accurate reports) to deceptive if some investors don't adjust their expectations. Ideally, a policy would balance accuracy with clear communication to avoid confusion and maintain market trust.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask about the company's plan to address the potential disruption and harm to small investors when transitioning to an unbiased reporting policy. Would they establish a process for educating investors on the change? Are there any contingency plans in place to mitigate market reactions?
