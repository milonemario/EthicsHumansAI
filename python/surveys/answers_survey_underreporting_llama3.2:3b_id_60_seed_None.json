This means that the change to the new policy would not address the underlying bias. Furthermore, introducing uncertainty and potentially hurting retail investors could have negative consequences for the company's reputation and performance in the long run. Therefore, I do not recommend changing to the new policy at this time.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should provide clear and accurate information to stakeholders, without withholding or distorting facts to achieve a desired outcome. The policy should also consider the potential impact on different groups of investors, including retail and sophisticated investors, and take steps to mitigate any potential negative effects. Additionally, the policy should be understandable and free from bias, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions.Ultimately, the policy's primary goal should be to serve the public interest, not just the company's interests.", "e6": "I would like to discuss potential strategies for communicating the change in reporting policy to investors, and how the company plans to address any concerns or criticisms that may arise.
