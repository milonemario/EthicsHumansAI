The current strategy involves hiding actual earnings data from investors, which is likely an unethical approach that could backfire financially and legally down the road.  Moreover, by being more transparent with their financial reporting, the company will foster trust and build stronger relationships with all stakeholders. ", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy for ABC should be truthful, transparent and unambiguous.  It must reflect the company's real financial performance while clearly indicating any potential challenges or strategic risks associated with its operations. It also needs to emphasize long-term stability for investors by avoiding overoptimistic or misleading expectations. This helps build trust in the company's management and fosters a more equitable, lasting relationship between the company and both internal and external stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, there would be some follow-up questions I would have for ABC's management team. To build trust and ensure a smooth transition to the new policy, I would ask about : *Why did they develop this policy?  What were the driving forces and what were the potential challenges in adopting this approach?*  *Do they believe an upfront change of this policy is best for all stakeholders (investors, employees, customers)? What are the projected long-term advantages from a new reporting policy?*  In addition, clarifying the specific details of any changes to accounting practices related to stock option compensation and revenue recognition will help alleviate concerns.
