The CFO's warning about potential market reaction highlights a valid risk that needs to be carefully considered before changing the policy. Further analysis is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the new policy in addressing the legal liability while minimizing this potential harm to innocent investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should clearly disclose material information that may affect investors' decisions, avoid misleading or biased reporting, and provide a reasonable basis for comparisons with peer companies. In the context of this scenario, the new policy's shift from a recognized but biased practice to an unbiased one could be seen as ethical if it is accompanied by clear disclosure and guidance on how to interpret the results. This would help maintain trust and confidence in the company's financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes.
