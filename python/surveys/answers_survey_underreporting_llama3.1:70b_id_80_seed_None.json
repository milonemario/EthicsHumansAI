The current practice of under-reporting earnings by 50 cents may be understood by some investors, but it's a deliberate bias that can lead to confusion and mistrust. By switching to unbiased reporting, ABC demonstrates its commitment to ethical business practices, even if it means short-term market adjustments. In the long run, this decision will foster trust among investors and other stakeholders.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should provide a clear and complete picture of the company's financial situation, without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. Considerations include avoiding manipulation for short-term gains, being mindful of the potential impact on retail investors versus sophisticated ones, and prioritizing long-term trust and credibility over potential market volatility. Additionally, an ethical policy would ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain consistency in reporting practices to facilitate informed decision-making.", "e6": "Yes. How do you plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors, analysts, and other stakeholders?
