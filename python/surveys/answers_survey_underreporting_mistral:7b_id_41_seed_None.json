While it is understandable that the head of investor relations may have concerns about communicating the change and potential negative reaction from the market or certain groups of investors, the benefits of transparency and eliminating biased reporting outweigh those risks.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy consistently follows the company's fiduciary duties and responsibilities towards its shareholders. This includes providing accurate, reliable, and transparent financial data, free from bias or manipulation to mislead investors. The new unbiased financial reporting policy protects long-term credibility and aligns with investor expectations for transparency in the market. While it is understandable that some may prefer the current policy due to the perceived short-term benefits, those considerations should not outweigh the company's accountability to its shareholder community as a whole, including retail investors. It's crucial that the firm avoids engaging in practices that promote informational asymmetries or unfair treatment of certain groups of investors.", "e6": "In addition to concerns about investor relations and market reaction, it is important to ask for more concrete data or research from the management team regarding the potential impact of the new reporting policy on retail investors. Specifically, requesting information about any historical evidence that shows retail investors systematically over-adjust reported EPS upward in comparison to institutional investors would help balance the CFO's arguments against a change in policy and support the case for greater transparency for all shareholders.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 4, "d": 2, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "A", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "A", "q9": null, "q10": "D"}
