A fair approach ensuring all relevant constituents can effectively comprehend reported information without any significant biases against their needs will probably foster trust and credibility as a responsible firm.", "e6": "What would be a potential timeline for implementing the new reporting policy, and how might they plan to manage/pre-communicate these changes effectively to their investors?
