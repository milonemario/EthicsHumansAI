It should not intentionally mislead or deceive stakeholders, and it should provide a clear and comprehensive picture of the company's financial situation. Considerations such as protecting small investors from market manipulation and avoiding false expectations should also be taken into account. In this context, the current policy, while potentially biased and misleading investors in theory, does not appear to cause significant harm due to the investor community's understanding of the bias. An ethical policy might weigh the potential benefits of accuracy against the risks of market unfairness.", "e6": "Yes.
