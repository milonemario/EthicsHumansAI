In contrast, the current policy is transparent and has been widely accepted by the investor community. While adjusting earnings downward can have a small effect, the potential harm to retail investors seems more significant. A better approach might be to clearly communicate the change in policy to investors and provide them with the necessary tools to adjust for any biases in earnings reporting.", "e5": "A good reporting policy should be transparent, unbiased, and clearly communicated to stakeholders. It should also consider the interests of all investors, particularly retail investors who may rely on the company's earnings reports to make investment decisions. Additionally, a policy that maintains consistency and predictability over time is more ethical than one that is arbitrary or subject to sudden changes. Finally, a policy that balances the need for accurate reporting with the need for investor confidence is most ethical and responsible.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask additional questions to better understand the potential risks and benefits of implementing a new policy. Specifically, I would like to know more about how the company plans to educate retail investors about the changes to the earnings reporting policy, and how they will ensure that all stakeholders are able to adjust their expectations accordingly.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "B", "q9": "2011 Fe}{", "q10": "B"}
