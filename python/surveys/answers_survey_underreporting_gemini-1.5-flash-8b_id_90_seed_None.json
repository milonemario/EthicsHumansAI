While a transition to a new, unbiased reporting policy carries short-term risk of investor confusion, the long-term ethical benefits and potential for stronger investor relationships outweigh the risks.  Open communication and proper investor relations strategies can mitigate potential short-term negative impacts.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and truthfulness.  It avoids intentional manipulation, even if some investors might understand the manipulation.  Materiality, clarity, and consistency are crucial; the policy must be understandable and consistently applied.  Crucially, the company's disclosures should reflect the actual financial performance, not just the desired perception.  A robust investor relations strategy, focused on proactively communicating the rationale behind any policy changes, is also essential to mitigate potential negative impacts on investor confidence.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask: 1) What specific investor relations strategies are planned to communicate the change in policy to investors, particularly retail investors, and how will you address concerns about potential short-term market reaction? 2) What is the anticipated impact on future earnings guidance, and how are the potential financial implications of this policy change being assessed? 3)  What contingency plans are in place to address potential investor lawsuits or negative market reactions?  4)  Can we quantify the potential advantage to sophisticated investors and assess if the potential risk to retail investors is worth the strategic goals?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
