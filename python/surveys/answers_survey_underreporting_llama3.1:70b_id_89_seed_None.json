Although some investors may initially be misled, ultimately, unbiased earnings reports will benefit both the company and its stakeholders in the long run. The current policy, while well-understood by many investors, may potentially disadvantage retail investors and create an uneven playing field. By adopting the new policy, the company demonstrates a commitment to honesty and fairness, which can enhance its reputation and credibility.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness. It should provide stakeholders with a clear and unbiased understanding of the company's financial performance, without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. Considerations such as consistency, comparability, and materiality are also important. In addition, an ethical reporting policy should consider the potential impact on different stakeholder groups, including retail investors, institutional investors, and creditors. It should be designed to promote informed decision-making, rather than catering to specific interests or agendas.", "e6": "Yes, I would have a few follow-up questions. How do you plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to stakeholders, and what steps will be taken to ensure that investors understand the implications of this change? Additionally, are there any plans to review or adjust other financial reporting practices to ensure consistency with the new policy? Finally, how will management monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the new policy in achieving its intended goals?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
