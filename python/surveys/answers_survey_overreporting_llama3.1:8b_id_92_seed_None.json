This consideration overrides any theoretical merits of an unbiased earnings reporting policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and consistent. It should not intentionally or unintentionally mislead stakeholders, including investors. Considering the context of this scenario, an ethical policy would also take into account the potential impact on different groups of investors, such as retail versus sophisticated fund managers, and aim to treat all investors fairly and equally. Additionally, the policy should be explainable and communicable to the public in a way that avoids confusing or misleading them.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to communicate the change in policy to investors, and what measures they will take to prevent retail investors from being misled or disadvantaged by not fully understanding the new policy.
