The current policy, despite investor awareness, is still deceptive in nature.

It presents a clear and unbiased picture of the company's financial performance, avoiding any intentional manipulation or distortion of data.  Even if common practice in an industry, a policy that knowingly misleads stakeholders -  regardless of whether they 'expect' it -  is unethical. The potential for harm to uninformed investors and the erosion of trust outweigh any short-term gains.", "e6": "Yes, I would have some follow-up questions.
