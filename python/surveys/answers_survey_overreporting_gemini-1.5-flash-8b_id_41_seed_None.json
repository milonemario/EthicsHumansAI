The new policy, though initially potentially creating market volatility, fosters trust and transparency, ultimately better serving the company's long-term interests and investor relations in the long run.  The potential for short-term market reaction to the change can be managed through investor communication.  Honesty and transparency are crucial for sustained investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or misleading information, even if some investors might initially react negatively.  Full disclosure of material information, clear communication of any changes in accounting policies, and a demonstrably consistent application of those policies are paramount.  The policy should be aligned with generally accepted accounting principles and not driven by short-term financial pressures or the desire to manipulate the market.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask about the specific anticipated market reaction to the policy change, including potential short-term impacts on share price and investor confidence.  Furthermore, I would inquire about the plan for communicating the policy change to investors, and the mechanisms for ensuring all stakeholders\u2014retail and institutional\u2014are informed and understand the rationale for the change.
