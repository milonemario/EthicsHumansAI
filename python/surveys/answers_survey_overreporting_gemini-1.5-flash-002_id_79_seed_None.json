Maintaining a deceptive practice, even if understood by some investors, erodes trust and ultimately harms the company's reputation and long-term value.  Adopting the new policy demonstrates commitment to integrity and will build stronger relationships with investors over time.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and unbiased.  It presents a fair and complete picture of the company's financial performance without manipulation or intentional obfuscation.  It considers the needs of all stakeholders, including investors of varying levels of sophistication, and aims to avoid misleading anyone, even unintentionally.  Consistency over time builds trust.  Compliance with all relevant accounting standards and regulations is paramount.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to quantify the potential short-term market impact of switching to the new policy.
