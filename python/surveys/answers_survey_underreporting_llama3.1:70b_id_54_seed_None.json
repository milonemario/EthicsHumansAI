The current policy's intentional under-reporting of earnings by $0.50 per share could be seen as deceptive, even if investors have grown accustomed to adjusting for it. Switching to an unbiased reporting method aligns with the company's commitment to honest communication with its stakeholders. Long-term benefits will outweigh any short-term disruption caused by the change.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and honesty. Reports should be free from intentional biases or omissions that could mislead stakeholders. Considerations include the potential impact on different stakeholder groups, such as retail investors versus institutional investors, and ensuring that changes to reporting policies are clearly communicated to avoid confusion. Additionally, policies should be designed to withstand scrutiny and be compliant with relevant laws and regulations. The policy should also strive to promote fairness, avoiding any advantage or disadvantage to particular groups of stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions for the management team. Specifically, I would ask how they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to all stakeholders, including retail investors, institutional investors, and analysts. I would also inquire about any potential costs or resource implications associated with implementing and maintaining the new policy. Additionally, I would seek clarification on how the company will manage any transitional issues that may arise during the implementation period, such as addressing questions from investors who are unfamiliar with the new reporting format.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
