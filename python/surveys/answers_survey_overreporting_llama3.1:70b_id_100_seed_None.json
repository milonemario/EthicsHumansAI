Although some investors may be temporarily confused, this change aligns with good governance principles and reduces the risk of potential legal liability or SEC investigation. In the long run, transparent and unbiased financial reporting will build trust with investors and stakeholders, ultimately benefiting the company's reputation and stability.", "e5": "I consider a reporting policy to be ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and consistent. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information, without omission or misrepresentation, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. Additionally, the policy should prioritize fairness and avoid favoring specific groups or individuals. In the context of public companies, this means following established accounting standards and regulatory guidelines, while also considering the needs and understanding of various stakeholder groups, such as investors, regulators, and the general public.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. Firstly, I would ask how they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to stakeholders, including investors and analysts, to minimize confusion and ensure a smooth transition. Secondly, I would inquire about their strategy for managing any potential short-term negative market reactions or impacts on the company's stock price. Additionally, I would seek clarification on whether there are any regulatory or accounting considerations that need to be addressed in implementing the new policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
