A clear move toward unbiased reporting will help rebuild trust within investors while ensuring transparency in corporate actions.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and consistent in its treatment of investors regardless of their affiliations. This includes ensuring accurate disclosures for any relevant financial information being reported. In the context at hand, the current policy can perpetuate a conflict of interest that disadvantages certain groups (e.g., retail investors) while putting more sophisticated investor groups at an advantage. Changing the policy to be without bias would promote fairness and trust among all stakeholders, ultimately benefitting both investors and ABC in the long run.", "e6": "1. For more clarity on ABC's overarching goals and the current management priorities, could you explain the trade-off between maintaining investor sentiment through a potentially biased financial report versus ethical governance with an accurate reporting policy? Specifically, what measures have been put in place to ensure fairness to all stakeholders including retail investors who may be less aware of the adjustment for biased earnings per share (EPS)? In other words, how can ABC's commitment to ethical behavior align with this practice and create a positive long-term outcome?\n2. Although current investors are aware of the earning adjustments, it was stated that there exists the possibility that legal issues or investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may arise if reporting is not brought to accurate levels. Can you please describe the potential effects this might have on ABC's reputation within and beyond the investment market?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 5}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumiurenqarm (1I/2017 U1 or A/2017 U1)", "q10": "D"}
