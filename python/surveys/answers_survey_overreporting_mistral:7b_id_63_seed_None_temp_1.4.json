The current policy, by overstating earnings, puts the firm at legal risk and undermines public trust. Ignoring potential risks associated with not changing biased reporting practices could lead to reputational harm, affecting the long-term value of the company for shareholders. Despite initial concerns about market response, addressing investors' knowledge about earnings biases should be facilitated more proactively by reassurance over a strong performance outlook without bias while also increasing education on accurate analysis methods for the average investor.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should place an equal emphasis on promoting transparency, fairness, and accountability in financial disclosures. With respect to ABC's scenario, it is essential that accuracy in reported earnings be foremost rather than appeasing any particular segment of the investing community or safeguarding short-term advantages for select investors who are better equipped to capitalize on information discrepancies between themselves, management, and less-informed retail investors. A reporting policy devoid of bias helps maintain investor confidence, trust, equality, and ensures integrity in corporate behavior over the long term.", "e6": "To evaluate the proposed change more effectively, here are my follow-up questions for the management team:", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
