Maintaining a biased system, even with investor awareness, is ultimately a less ethical and sustainable long-term strategy.  A clear and unbiased approach, while potentially facing initial market resistance, fosters trust and a healthier relationship with investors in the long run.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deception, even if seemingly beneficial in the short term.  Material information must be presented truthfully and completely, regardless of potential market reactions.  Consideration should also be given to investor sophistication, the company's overall reputation, and the long-term impact on stakeholder trust and the integrity of financial markets.", "e6": "Yes.  I would want to understand the projected impact of the policy change on stock price, potentially through stress tests.  Additionally, I'd need more details on the historical patterns and magnitude of the bias adjustment made by investors and how the company plans to communicate the change to investors to minimize misinterpretations.
