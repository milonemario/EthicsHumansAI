In light of both legal obligations and the ethical imperative to provide accurate financial reporting, we will have no other choice but to implement the new earnings reporting policy for transparency purposes with clear external and internal communication of the alteration in such policy.", "e5": "At its foundation, an ethically sound EPS reporting policy should foster clarity and accuracy, minimize deception, maintain consistency with appropriate regulations, uphold the trust between board members, shareholders, and other stakeholders, and adhere to legal advice to limit any form of liability. Incorporating these principles allows investors \u2013both retail and institutional alike\u2013 to make fully informed investment decisions. Such a responsible policy promotes market efficiency while facilitating the well-being of less experienced or underprivileged market participants.", "e6": "I would like to understand the estimated timeline and resources required to re-establish transparency in ABC Company's earnings reporting, particularly with communication about changes made to minimize confusion for retail investors and improve equity competitiveness among diverse investor types.
