This means that financial reports should accurately reflect the company's performance without intentional manipulation or omission of information. The policy should also be consistent and easily understandable to all stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and the general public. Furthermore, consideration should be given to avoiding unintended consequences, such as misleading certain groups of investors, and ensuring that the policy aligns with regulatory requirements and industry best practices.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. These include: How do you plan to communicate the change in policy to investors and other stakeholders? What steps will be taken to ensure that all employees understand the new policy and its implications?
