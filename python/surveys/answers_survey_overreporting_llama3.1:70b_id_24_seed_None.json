Reporting earnings accurately is essential for building trust with investors and maintaining the company's reputation for integrity. Moreover, the current policy may be seen as deceptive or misleading, even if investors have adjusted to it. Changing to the new policy would demonstrate the company's commitment to transparency and accuracy in financial reporting.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should clearly disclose all relevant information to stakeholders without intentionally misleading or deceiving them. The context of the company's relationship with its investors, regulators, and other stakeholders is also important, as they have a right to know how their interests are being represented. Timeliness and consistency of reporting are also key considerations. Furthermore, I would expect an ethical policy to acknowledge potential conflicts of interest and take steps to mitigate them. Ultimately, the goal of an ethical reporting policy should be to foster trust, promote integrity, and support informed decision-making.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more information on how they plan to communicate the change in policy to investors, particularly retail investors who may not be aware of the bias in the current reporting practice. I would also like to know what steps they will take to ensure that all stakeholders understand the new policy and its implications for the company's financial reporting. Additionally, I would ask about their plan for addressing any potential short-term negative reaction from investors and how they intend to measure the success of the new policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "'Oumuamua, a peculiarly shaped asteroid or comet from another star system, discovered in 2017.", "q10": "B"}
