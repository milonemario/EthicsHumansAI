Maintaining the current policy, despite its inherent bias, seems the more prudent course of action to protect the company's stock price and potentially mitigate harm to retail investors who may be less sophisticated in interpreting the change.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It must clearly communicate its methodology, avoid misleading investors, and be consistently applied.  Context is crucial; investor sophistication, the market's understanding of the company, and the potential impact on various stakeholder groups (including retail investors) must be considered when assessing ethical implications.  Ultimately, the policy should foster trust and confidence, even if it results in potentially fluctuating stock prices.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd want to understand the specific details of the anticipated market reaction to the new policy, including data from previous policy changes and a detailed market impact analysis.  Also, how will the company communicate this change to different investor segments (sophisticated vs. retail) to minimize misunderstandings?  Finally, what contingency plans are in place to address potential negative investor sentiment or stock price volatility?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
