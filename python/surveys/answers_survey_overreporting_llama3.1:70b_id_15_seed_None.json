Although some investors may initially be misled by the change, clear communication from the company can mitigate this risk. The benefits of adopting a transparent and unbiased reporting practice outweigh the short-term challenges, ultimately positioning ABC as a leader in corporate governance and ethics.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and consistently applied. It should clearly disclose all relevant information to stakeholders, without manipulating or omitting data to influence perceptions. Additionally, the policy should prioritize fairness, avoiding actions that could advantage some investors over others. In the context of public companies like ABC, regulatory compliance and adherence to standards such as GAAP are also essential considerations. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy fosters trust, accountability, and informed decision-making among stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. For example: What specific steps will be taken to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and stakeholders? How will the company ensure that all relevant parties, including retail investors, are informed about the change? Are there any plans to provide additional context or explanations to help investors understand the implications of the new policy? Additionally, I would like to know more about the potential risks associated with the transition and how the management team intends to mitigate them.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
