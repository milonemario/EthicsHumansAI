While changing the policy might have short-term effects on the market due to incorrect investor assumptions, long-term trust, credibility, and ethical reputation are critical for ABC's success. It would be unethical and potentially hazardous to continue underreporting earnings by 50 cents and could expose the company to legal action or investigations. The CFO's concern over small retail investors can be mitigated with proper education and communication about the policy change. Thus, it is recommended that the company should adopt the new policy of unbiased financial reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is one which provides transparency, integrity, truthfulness, and fairness to all stakeholders. The policy should be free from bias or manipulation of numbers through any means such as under-reporting or overstating earnings. Such a policy promotes investor trust, credibility, and compliance with laws and regulations. For ABC, a new policy without earnings bias is more ethical since it aligns reporting with actual financial performance, making it easier for the board to make strategic decisions in good faith based on accurate financial data. The context of small retail investors being potentially disadvantaged by sophisticated hedge funds should not impede adopting an ethical policy, and instead, the company could take measures to inform retail investors of the policy change with clear communication, thus ensuring a level playing field for all.", "e6": "I would ask for clarification about the specific legal liability concerns and investigate if any peers in the industry have faced similar issues. Additionally, I request to explore alternatives to help improve investor relations' communication around the proposed change.
