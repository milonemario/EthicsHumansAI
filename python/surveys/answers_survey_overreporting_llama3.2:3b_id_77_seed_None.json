Additionally, sophisticated hedge funds may exploit their understanding of the bias to trade at an advantage against retail investors, which could lead to unequal treatment and fairness issues. In contrast, the current policy's transparency allows investors to adjust their expectations and make informed decisions.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should accurately reflect the company's financial performance without misrepresenting its true situation. The policy should also consider the impact on stakeholders, including investors, customers, and employees. In this context, a bias that is widely understood by investors but not explicitly disclosed can be seen as problematic. Ideally, a reporting policy would provide clear guidance on what information is included in the financial statements and how it should be interpreted, ensuring that all stakeholders have a consistent understanding of the company's performance.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions regarding the potential impact on retail investors who may not be aware of the new policy or how to adjust their expectations.
