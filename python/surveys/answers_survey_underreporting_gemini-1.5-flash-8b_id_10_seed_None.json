The CFO's concerns about retail investors and the need for a credible investor relations strategy suggest that maintaining the current policy (with its understood bias) might be the more prudent choice in the short term, despite its ethical shortcomings.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, consistently applied, and accurately reflect the company's true financial performance.  Materiality, investor understanding, and potential impacts on various stakeholder groups (including retail and institutional investors) are crucial considerations.  Any adjustments or estimations should be clearly disclosed and justified, avoiding manipulation or deception, even if the bias is understood by some.  Ultimately, the policy must engender trust and confidence in the company's reporting practices.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask for a detailed market analysis of how a policy shift might impact various investor segments, including retail and institutional investors.  A specific projected timeline for investor education/communication, and a plan for addressing concerns and questions should also be outlined.  Further, what specific measures are in place to mitigate any perceived unfair advantage for sophisticated investors trading against retail investors under the new policy?
