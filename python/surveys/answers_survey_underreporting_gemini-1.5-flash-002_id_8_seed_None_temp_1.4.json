The new policy promotes transparency, which is vital for long-term investor trust.

It presents financial information in a clear, unbiased, and easily understandable manner.  It avoids manipulative practices designed to artificially inflate or deflate performance.  Consideration should be given to all stakeholders, ensuring that reporting doesn't unfairly advantage some while disadvantaging others.  Consistency over time is also crucial to build investor trust.", "e6": "I'd ask about their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, focusing on mitigating the anticipated short-term negative market reaction.
