By not publicly acknowledging these adjusted earnings, the company reduces its potential public scrutiny and potential liability. In contrast, attempting to change to an unbiased reporting system without full investor understanding could lead to decreased stock value and investor trust, potentially resulting in SEC investigation due to material restatements, further compounding issues.", "e5": "In evaluating an ethical reporting policy, I would look for policies that ensure accuracy and fairness. This includes disclosing material, relevant information without misleading stakeholders or creating unnecessary complexity. An ideal policy should also promote transparency, accountability, and investor confidence in the company's financial representation. Considerations in this context include protecting smaller investors from unfair competitive disadvantage as well as managing potential reputational harm within the firm for making changes.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask follow-up questions about how the company would address potential concerns from smaller investors, such as support for education campaigns or financial guidance to help level the playing field. Additionally, I would inquire about what specific measures the management team has in place to handle any public scrutiny, backlash, or criticism resulting from potentially modifying existing reporting policies and if steps were being consider toward improving market conditions which may impact ABC equity going forward.", "e7": "Against", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 1, "g": 2, "h": 1}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
