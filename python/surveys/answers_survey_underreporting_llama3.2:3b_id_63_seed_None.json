The benefits of providing unbiased earnings outweigh the potential short-term volatility and negative impacts on retail investors who have grown accustomed to the adjusted EPS. By being transparent about the reporting change, we can maintain our integrity as a company while also minimizing risks associated with maintaining an outdated business practice.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent, accurate, and free from bias or manipulation. A policy should clearly communicate any material adjustments or assumptions made in earnings calculation, such as the 50-cent adjustment used by ABC. The policy should also be able to withstand scrutiny from stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and auditor, without raising concerns about misrepresentation or deceit. Additionally, the policy should prioritize consistency, reliability, and comparability of financial reports over short-term gains or special interests.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 5, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 CQ1", "q10": "B"}
