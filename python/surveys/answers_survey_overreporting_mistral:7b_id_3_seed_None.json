While there may be a period of readjustment for investors, maintaining an unbiased policy avoids potential legal risks and promotes ethical reporting. Addressing any disadvantages to small retail investors can also be prioritized concurrently through education and disclosure efforts.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and fairness. A bias-free policy reduces ambiguity and potential misinterpretations of financial performance. Regarding the current circumstances at ABC company, considering both the long-term interests of investors and the concerns of the CFO, an unbiased policy would be appropriate; however, it's essential for investor relations to communicate transparently about the change and provide educational resources for all categories of investors to minimize potential disadvantages experienced by retail investors.", "e6": "I would ask management questions to expand on their concerns and suggestions for addressing the issues. Here are some questions: 1) How might the firm's legal counsel address potential legal risks or investigations should ABC stick with the current policy? 2) What steps can be taken by investor relations to credibly communicate the change in reporting policy despite market fluctuations? 3) Are there creative ways that retail investors could be protected from disadvantageous positions when trading against more sophisticated investors? Discussing these points would aid the board in making an informed decision about whether or not to change the financial reporting policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 5, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "The first interstellar object detected passing through our solar system is Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
