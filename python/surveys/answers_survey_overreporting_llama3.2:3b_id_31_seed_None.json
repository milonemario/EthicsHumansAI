While the new policy aims to promote transparency, it also risks causing harm to vulnerable retail investors who may not be able to adjust their expectations quickly enough. Phasing out the bias gradually over time could help mitigate this risk while still allowing for more accurate reporting of earnings.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical when it prioritizes honesty, transparency, and clarity. It should accurately reflect a company's financial performance without misleading or deceiving stakeholders. In the context of publicly traded companies like ABC, this means providing earnings reports that are free from artificial adjustments or biases that could be expected by investors. Additionally, the policy should consider the impact on all stakeholders, including retail investors who may be less sophisticated and more vulnerable to market fluctuations. Such policies should therefore aim to strike a balance between transparency and protectiveness.", "e6": "Can you provide more information on how adjusting the reporting policy will affect the firm's relationships with sophisticated hedge funds, and are there any plans to monitor or mitigate any potential negative impacts on retail investors?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "2017 UF_{17}", "q10": "B"}
