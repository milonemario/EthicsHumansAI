Sophisticated hedge funds may be able to adjust for the bias, but retail investors may not have the same level of knowledge. Changing the policy could lead to a short-term adjustment followed by negative consequences, which may outweigh any potential benefits of increased transparency.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that consistently and accurately reflects a company's financial performance, without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. Key characteristics include transparency, honesty, and fairness. The policy should also be free from bias and be able to withstand scrutiny, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. Furthermore, the policy should consider the potential impact on different investor groups, with particular care for those who may be vulnerable to exploitation, such as retail investors. Lastly, the policy should be subject to review and revision to ensure it remains aligned with changing environmental and regulatory contexts.", "e6": "I would ask how they plan to address the potential for investor confusion and disproportionate market reactions among sophisticated investors who will continue to adjust their expectations, and whether any additional support or education programs can be established to mitigate this effect.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 4, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Siding Spring)", "q10": "B"}
