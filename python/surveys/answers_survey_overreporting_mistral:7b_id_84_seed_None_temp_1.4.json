Changing to a new, unbiased policy fosters transparency and accountability while promoting investors\u2019 long-term interests. An effective investor relations team can provide explanations to all levels of investors, reducing information asymmetry in financial markets, thus protecting less sophisticated retail customers.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy upholds accuracy, impartially, transparency, and adheres to all relevant accounting standards without bias due to internal objectives. Relevant information must be consistently reported without the intent to mislead the public. In this instance, ABC's practice of EPS over-reporting is unethical as it raises risks of confusion, diminished credibility, and potential regulatory issues. A no-bias policy maintains trust by presenting a comprehensive financial picture promoting investor autonomy to make informed decisions, without manipulating stock prices or exploiting retail investors.", "e6": "Questions I would have for the management team include: 1. Were previous earnings increases a result of legitimate factors or due to creative accounting methods? If it was the latter, how is that sustainable in the long term? 2. Can other companies within our competitors perform similarly without the need to resort to earnings manipulation? What differentiates ABC's financial practices from them? 3. Who has profited by maintaining the status quo with respect to our earnings reporting? 4. What measures does management suggest ensuring small retail investors have accurate information about performance and aren't exploited in equity trades given this transition to a less biased reported earnings plan?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "", "q10": "D"}
