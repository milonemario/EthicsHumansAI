While increased transparency is a positive goal, the risk that some sophisticated investors may take advantage of small investors by trading on their expectation of biased reporting outweighs the benefits. Additionally, there are valid concerns about market volatility and potential harm to retail investors. A more nuanced approach, such as phasing in the change or implementing disclosure requirements, might be a more suitable solution to balance transparency with investor protection.", "e5": "A reporting policy should prioritize truthfulness, transparency, and stakeholder protection. It should be free from intentional bias or manipulation, ensuring that financial information is accurate and presented in a way that enables informed decision-making. The policy should also consider the potential impact on various groups, including small investors, sophisticated traders, and those with limited market expertise. Furthermore, the policy should promote consistency and predictability, allowing stakeholders to understand the firm's performance and make timely investment decisions.
