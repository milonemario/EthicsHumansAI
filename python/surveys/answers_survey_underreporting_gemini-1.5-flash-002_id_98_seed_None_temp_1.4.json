Maintaining the current policy is dishonest and unsustainable.  Building trust with investors based on truth is crucial for long-term success, even if it means facing temporary market challenges.  The new policy ultimately aligns better with corporate social responsibility.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and fairness.  It avoids deliberate misrepresentation or manipulation of information, ensuring all stakeholders have access to a clear and unbiased understanding of the company's financial performance.  It should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups and strive to prevent any unfair advantage based on access to information or understanding of the reporting practices.  Consistency over time is vital to maintaining trust.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to detail their plan for communicating the policy change to investors, including how they will address potential concerns and mitigate the short-term market impact.  I'd also ask for a quantitative analysis of the potential risks and benefits of both policies, considering various investor types and their reactions.  Finally, I would want a timeline for the implementation of the new policy and a mechanism to monitor its effectiveness.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
