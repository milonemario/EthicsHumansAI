Although some investors may initially react negatively due to the change in reporting style, the company will benefit from a more accurate representation of its earnings. This shift aligns with ethical business practices and reduces the risk of legal liability or investigations by regulatory bodies. In the long run, a transparent and honest approach will foster trust among investors and stakeholders.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and unbiased. This means that financial reports should accurately reflect the company's performance without any intentional misrepresentation or manipulation of data. Additionally, an ethical policy would prioritize fairness, ensuring that all stakeholders have equal access to information and are not misled or deceived. In the context of publicly traded companies, this also involves considering the potential impact on vulnerable investors, such as retail investors who may lack the sophistication to understand complex financial reporting nuances.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to elaborate on their plan for communicating the change in reporting policy to investors and stakeholders. Specifically, how do they plan to inform the market about the transition from biased to unbiased earnings reporting?
