The current policy, although intentionally not misleading, may still be perceived as deceptive or biased. The new policy promotes fairness and accuracy, which can foster trust with investors and reduce potential legal liabilities. While there may be short-term consequences, such as market volatility or investor confusion, the long-term benefits of transparency and honesty outweigh these concerns.", "e5": "I consider a reporting policy to be ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. This means that financial information should be presented in a clear and understandable manner, without any intentional omissions or misrepresentations. Additionally, the policy should prioritize fairness and avoid providing an unfair advantage or disadvantage to certain stakeholders, such as small investors versus sophisticated hedge funds. In the context of publicly traded companies, I also consider it essential for reporting policies to comply with regulatory requirements and maintain consistency over time, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on reliable data.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask additional questions. What specific steps will be taken to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors and ensure a smooth transition?
