While there may be short-term market adjustments due to investors' initial misunderstanding of the change, the long-term benefits of increased credibility and trust with stakeholders outweigh these risks. Additionally, the new policy reduces the company's exposure to potential legal liability and SEC investigation, which could have severe consequences for the firm's reputation and financial well-being.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and unbiased. This means providing accurate and complete information to stakeholders in a clear and timely manner. In the context of financial reporting, this includes avoiding practices that artificially inflate or deflate earnings. Considerations such as materiality, comparability, and consistency are also important. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should prioritize simplicity and accessibility, avoiding jargon and technical language that may confuse non-experts. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy is one that promotes trust, accountability, and informed decision-making among stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to ensure a smooth transition to the new policy. Some of these questions include: What is the proposed timeline for implementing the change in policy? How will the company communicate the change in policy to stakeholders, including investors and analysts? Are there any planned investor relations efforts to educate and reassure retail investors about the impact of the change? How will the company monitor and address potential short-term market adjustments resulting from the change?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
