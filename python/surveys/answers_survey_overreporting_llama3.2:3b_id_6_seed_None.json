The current practice of over-reporting earnings by 50 cents has been well-understood by investors, who adjust for this bias in their analysis.

This approach will ultimately build stronger relationships with our investors and enhance our company's reputation.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical when it prioritizes honesty, transparency, and clarity.

Additionally, policies should consider the potential impact on stakeholders, including retail investors who may be more vulnerable to market fluctuations. Ethical policies also prioritize consistency and fairness, ensuring that all investors are treated equally and without bias. Furthermore, companies should disclose any assumptions or adjustments made to their reporting standards in a clear and understandable manner.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions regarding the potential implications of adopting an unbiased reporting policy on our company's competitiveness, financial flexibility, and ability to manage stakeholder expectations.
