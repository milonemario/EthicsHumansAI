Switching to a transparent, unbiased reporting system builds long-term trust with investors. While initial market reaction might be negative, the improved ethical standing and eventual recognition of the company's true performance will outweigh short-term losses.  The potential for harming retail investors under the current system is also a significant concern.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and consistency.  It avoids manipulative practices designed to mislead investors, regardless of whether such practices are easily detected.  Fairness to all investors, regardless of sophistication, is paramount.  The policy should be clearly communicated, and any changes should be explained thoroughly.  Consideration should be given to the potential impact on different investor groups, minimizing the risk of unfair advantage.", "e6": "I would ask for a detailed plan to communicate the policy change to investors, addressing concerns about potential short-term market reactions and the steps to ensure all investor groups understand the shift.
