This approach also reduces the risk of potential legal liabilities and SEC investigations that may arise from a continued bias. Although there is a short-term risk that some investors may be misled or punished due to the absence of a familiar bias adjustment, I believe this is outweighed by the long-term benefits of maintaining integrity in our financial reporting.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and communicated clearly to all stakeholders. It should also consider the potential impact on small retail investors who may not fully understand the implications of a changing policy. A policy that is fair to both existing sophisticated investors who can adjust for biases and smaller investors who may be negatively affected is desirable. Additionally, an ethical policy should prioritize compliance with applicable laws and regulations, minimizing the risk of financial reporting errors or misleading information. Ultimately, honesty and integrity in financial reporting are essential for maintaining trust with investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask additional follow-up questions.
