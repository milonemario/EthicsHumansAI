Although there may be a temporary reaction in the stock price, it's better to report unbiased earnings per share upfront rather than relying on investors to adjust for a known bias. This approach also reduces the risk of potential legal liability or an SEC investigation. In the long run, adopting the new policy will foster a culture of openness and accountability, benefiting the company and its stakeholders.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and consistency. The policy should provide stakeholders with reliable and unbiased information, free from manipulation or omission of material facts. Considerations such as the potential impact on vulnerable investors (e.g., retail investors), the need to balance competitiveness with honesty, and compliance with regulatory requirements are also essential. Furthermore, an ethical reporting policy should be adaptable to changing circumstances and open to scrutiny, allowing for continuous improvement and correction of any misleading information.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions for the management team. How do they plan to communicate the change in policy to investors and stakeholders? What measures will be taken to ensure that all investors, including retail investors, understand the implications of the new policy? Are there any plans to provide additional guidance or support to help investors adjust to the unbiased earnings reports? Additionally, how will the management team monitor and address any potential negative reactions from the market?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua (officially named 1I/2017 U1)", "q10": "B"}
