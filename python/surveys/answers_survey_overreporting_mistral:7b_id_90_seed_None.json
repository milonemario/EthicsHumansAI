The board should take responsibility to disclose the bias, protect investor interests overall, and change to the new policy without bias.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should accurately and transparently disclose information to all stakeholders, minimizing bias or inaccuracies that could potentially mislead investors. In this case, the current practice of over-reporting earnings by 50 cents is unethical as it creates uncertainty for smaller investors who may not adjust their valuations accordingly, while larger hedge funds may exploit this inconsistency to gain a competitive advantage. A reporting policy that reflects true performance and consistently discloses any adjustments for fairness in shareholder communications should be considered ethical in this context.", "e6": "To clarify, I would ask the following questions about potential strategies for handling the transition to an unbiased reporting policy: 1) Have you explored communicating a clear and transparent rationale for the shift in financial reporting policy, emphasizing compliance with regulations and protecting all investors? 2) How can investor relations ensure consistency in communicating the new policy to retail investors, minimizing potential disadvantages? 3) Can the board consider implementing educational resources or tools to help smaller investors understand changes in the firm's reporting policy and adjust their investment decisions accordingly?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
