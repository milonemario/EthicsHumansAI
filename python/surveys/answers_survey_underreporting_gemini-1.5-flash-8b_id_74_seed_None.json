The CFO's concerns about investor reaction and the potential for short-term gains followed by long-term punishment highlight a potential negative impact on the company's stock price and reputation.  Maintaining the current policy, despite its ethical shortcomings, is likely a more prudent course of action given the complexities of the situation and the desire to avoid investor distrust and market volatility.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or deception, even if seemingly beneficial in the short term.  Crucially, it considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the wider public.  Contextual factors like the company's financial health, market conditions, and investor sophistication are vital for evaluating the ethical implications of different reporting methods.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd want to understand the precise details of the current policy's impact on reported earnings, the potential magnitude of the earnings adjustments by investors, and the projected long-term financial consequences of the policy change.  Further, I'd ask about alternative communication strategies that could more effectively explain the change in policy to investors without jeopardizing the integrity of the company's financial reporting and potentially alienating investors.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
