The potential market downturn caused by investors misinterpreting the change could outweigh any long-term benefits of transparency.  Careful consideration of investor communication strategies and safeguards to protect retail investors are needed before transitioning to an unbiased reporting system.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading investors, even inadvertently, and must consider the potential impact on different investor types (retail vs. institutional).  Materiality and consistency are key; reported results should reflect the true financial performance, and the reporting method should not change arbitrarily.  Finally, the policy should withstand scrutiny by independent parties and be defensible in the face of market analysis.", "e6": "Yes.
