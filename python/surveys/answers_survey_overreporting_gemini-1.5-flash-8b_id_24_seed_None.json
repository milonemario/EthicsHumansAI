While the current policy might appear to protect stock price in the short-term, transparency and honest reporting build long-term investor trust and confidence.

It avoids manipulation, whether intentional or through a system that creates a predictable bias.  It must also consider the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors of different sophistication levels.  Full disclosure of methodologies and assumptions is crucial, enabling informed decision-making. Finally, the policy should be consistently applied, demonstrating impartiality.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to understand: 1) The specific calculations and adjustments used in the current policy to understand the magnitude and rationale for the bias. 2)  The potential short-term and long-term impacts on stock price, investor sentiment, and the company's reputation if the policy is changed.  3)  Detailed strategies for communicating the change to investors, particularly the retail investor segment, to mitigate potential negative market reactions.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
