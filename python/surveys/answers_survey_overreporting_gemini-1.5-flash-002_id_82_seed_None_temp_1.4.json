The risk of short-term negative market reaction is less damaging than the ethical compromise of the existing policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents financial information fairly, without intentional bias or manipulation to influence investor decisions.  It also considers the potential for different levels of investor sophistication and strives to ensure fair access to information.  Maintaining consistent reporting standards is also crucial for building trust and promoting fair market participation.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies the investor relations team plans to use to communicate the change in policy and mitigate potential market misinterpretations. I'd also inquire about any historical data on investor reactions to similar policy shifts within the industry, to better assess the likely short-term impact.
