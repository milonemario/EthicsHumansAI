The CFO's arguments focus on the perceived advantage that sophisticated investors might gain over retail ones. However, this is a short-term disadvantage when considering the improved relationships and trust with regulators and investors long term.", "e5": "Ethical reporting policies should be transparent, consistent, clear, and fair to all stakeholders. The current policy's over-reporting may provide a short-term advantage but is not sustainable in the long term, as it introduces biases that risk legal consequences or harm investor trust. A reporting policy should consider investor understanding and not exploit their lack of knowledge. In this case, communicating the change and educating the market about the new 'no-bias' policy effectively would be key.", "e6": "In this situation, I would ask several questions to clarify and gather more information from the management team to make an informed decision. Firstly, I would ask for insights on the quantifiable potential impact of the policy change on the firm's stock performance over time compared to maintaining the biased reporting policy. Secondly, I would request a detailed plan to communicate the new no-bias policy effectively to all investors, focusing on minimizing negative market reaction and protecting retail investors from potential disadvantages. Lastly, I would seek additional information about any potential strategies to ensure transparency, build investor trust, and educate market participants about the reasons behind the change to the new policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "A", "q8": "C", "q9": "I cannot answer this question as it is unrelated to the described scenario regarding the ABC company and their financial reporting policy", "q10": "D"}
