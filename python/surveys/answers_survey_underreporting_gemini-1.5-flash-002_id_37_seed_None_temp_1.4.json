The new policy promotes transparency and fairness, even if it leads to initial market corrections.  Building trust with all investors, not just sophisticated ones, is crucial for long-term success.  The potential short-term pain is outweighed by long-term ethical considerations and increased investor confidence.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, presenting a fair and unbiased representation of the company's financial performance.  It should be consistently applied, easily understandable by investors of all levels of sophistication, and avoid any deliberate manipulation to influence investor perception.  It should also consider the potential impact of the policy on different investor groups and mitigate any unfair advantages or disadvantages.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific communication plan to accompany the policy change, how the company plans to educate retail investors about the new reporting approach, and what contingency plans are in place to manage potential short-term market reactions.
