Additionally, it may disadvantage retail investors who may still adjust the reported earnings upward by 50 cents, placing them at a disadvantage compared to more sophisticated hedge funds.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, and unbiased. It should not intentionally mislead or deceive stakeholders. Additionally, it should not create an uneven playing field where certain groups have access to more information than others, thereby giving them a competitive advantage. In the context of financial reporting, this means that earnings should reflect the true financial performance of the company, without bias or manipulation. The policy should also be consistent and understandable, with clear disclosure of all relevant information. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy should maintain public trust and confidence in the integrity of financial reporting.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. What are the specific risks associated with changing to a new policy that reports earnings without bias? How will the company ensure that all stakeholders, including retail investors, are protected from potential losses if they adjust their expectations based on previously biased reports? Additionally, what steps can be taken to increase transparency and prevent more sophisticated investors from exploiting this information advantage?", "e7": "Against", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
