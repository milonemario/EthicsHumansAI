While changing policies may present some challenges in effectively communicating this change to investors, maintaining the integrity of ABC's financial reporting should be a top priority.", "e5": "A truly ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and fair. It should consistently reflect the company's financial performance without bias, ensuring that earnings per share are reported truthfully and honestly. In this context, any concerns about investor education, equity issuance, or potential short-term market reaction must not compromise the reporting policy's integrity. Retail investors must be protected from exploitation, and a reporting policy should not provide an unfair advantage to sophisticated hedge funds over other investors.", "e6": "It is essential to clarify several areas in this situation. First, I would like to confirm that management understands and acknowledges the potential legal and ethical risks associated with biased earnings reporting. Second, I am concerned about the rationale for maintaining the current policy based on investor relations and market reaction considerations\u2014particularly given the short-term rewards vs. long-term consequences. Third, I would like to inquire if management has considered the development of effective communication strategies to ensure that retail investors are adequately informed about changes to financial reporting policies. Lastly, I am interested in learning whether management possesses any data demonstrating that this practice benefits or disadvantages investors and if a cost-benefit analysis has been conducted.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 3, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
