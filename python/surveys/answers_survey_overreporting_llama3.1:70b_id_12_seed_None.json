The current policy, although well-understood by investors, could still be viewed as misleading or deceptive. In contrast, the new policy ensures that reported earnings accurately reflect the company's true financial performance. This change would align with best practices for publicly traded companies, help to maintain investor trust, and reduce potential legal liability.", "e5": "I view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, honest, and unbiased. The policy should clearly present financial information that accurately reflects the company's performance, without any intention to mislead or deceive stakeholders. Considerations such as consistency with accounting standards, compliance with regulatory requirements, and protection of vulnerable investors (e.g., retail investors) are also important. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should be easily understandable by all stakeholders, including those without specialized financial knowledge. Overall, the policy should prioritize fairness, accountability, and trust-building in its reporting practices.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide more insights on how they plan to communicate the change in reporting policy to investors, particularly retail investors who may not be aware of the bias in the current policy. Additionally, I would like to know what procedures will be put in place to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are informed about the change and understand its implications. Finally, I would ask about any potential contingency plans in case of a negative market reaction to the change in reporting policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
