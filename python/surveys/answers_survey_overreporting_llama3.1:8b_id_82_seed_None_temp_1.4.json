Moreover, by transitioning away from an unambiguously understood practice that has benefited all investors alike regardless experience level or familiarity with company's financials (hedge funds more and retail less so), the company may not ensure an absolutely unbiased outcome where even those most attuned still struggle properly.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that is transparent and honest, without intentional misdirection or manipulation. Transparency refers to complete and accurate communication of all relevant information necessary for investors (or any party impacted by this information) can have accurate views; this means no implicit bias, like what in current policy at ABC may seem more intuitive with company backing investor understanding on EPS through adjusting earnings themselves rather letting people interpret those biases independently within firm management. Honesty suggests making adjustments without the possibility that reported figure will mislead certain groups in preference towards particular outcomes which could create systemic issues \u2013 all have necessary clarity into future.", "e6": "Yes. What are the long-term implications of perpetuating a policy that may be seen as misleading or, to put more accurately, less accurately informed reporting over the reported outcome on potential legal actions, how may we address our existing investors concerns when we introduce new practice making sure they are updated on process, particularly small investors so their understanding is aligned with that for professional investors' understanding with no gaps remaining open as transition from this status quo starts, if indeed moving forth and abandoning these more easily quantifiable values in favor of clearer unbiased figures? More clarity would really alleviate apprehension.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 9, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "C", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
