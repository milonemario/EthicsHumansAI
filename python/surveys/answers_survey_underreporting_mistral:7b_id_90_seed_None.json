The potential short-term market volatility due to the change may be challenging, but transparency and accurate earnings reports are crucial for long-term credibility with investors. Addressing investor concerns through clear communication from the management team will help ensure a smoother transition.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, accurate, consistent, and fair to all stakeholders. The current policy under-reports earnings per share by 50 cents, which is misleading to investors and could lead to legal liability or SEC investigation. A no-bias policy is preferred for its accuracy and transparency, as it would ensure that the reported earnings truly reflect the company's financial performance. Retail investors deserve equal access to reliable information and not be taken advantage of by sophisticated hedge funds. Addressing investor concerns through clear communication from the management team can help ease the transition to a more ethical policy.", "e6": "Based on the information provided, I would have some follow-up questions to help clarify and support informed decision-making. First, I would ask for detailed financial analysis of potential risks and benefits to all stakeholders under both the current and no-bias policy options. Second, I want clarity about communication strategies and investor education plans if the board were to change to a new policy without bias, ensuring that retail investors are not disadvantaged against sophisticated investors. Lastly, I request a more in-depth discussion on ethical considerations regarding accuracy, transparency, fairness, and compliance standards when making financial reporting decisions.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 2, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 1, "h": 5}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "The question presented is about financial decision-making by a board member of ABC company, specifically regarding adjusting its earnings per share (EPS) reporting policy.
