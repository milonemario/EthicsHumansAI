Investors would benefit from having an accurate reporting and fair opportunities, minimizing possible legal liability and safeguarding retail investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy ensures accuracy, transparency, honesty, completeness, and fairness, ensuring reliable information is available to investors. A consistent practice of under-reporting earnings per share with known adjustment from the investor community raises regulatory risk and does little for integrity or community trust. Incorporating bias through consistent practices distorts real performance and places the company and small investors at a potential disadvantage. Switching policies to one free of bias, regardless of market responses or investor concerns over understanding the policy shift, preserves ethical standards in corporate finance.", "e6": "Is there a plan to transparently communicate the change of policy in a way that ensures all investors aware of the bias-causing practices?
