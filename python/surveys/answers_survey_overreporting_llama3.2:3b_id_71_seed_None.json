On the other hand, sophisticated investors may understand and capitalize on the new policy's advantages. I believe a more nuanced approach might be needed, potentially involving incremental steps or targeted communications to minimize disruption while addressing concerns about transparency and investor education.", "e5": "I would view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes transparency and honesty, while also considering the potential impacts on various stakeholders. A key characteristic is that the policy clearly communicates any material biases or adjustments made to financial reports. Additionally, the policy should be transparent about its origins, rationale, and any changes made. It should also consider the needs of all investors, including retail investors who may rely on established biases, while avoiding misleading or deceitful practices.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask the management team about potential strategies to gradually phase out the 50-cent bias adjustment and educate retail investors on the change.
