The benefits of accuracy and transparency outweigh possible short-term market volatility.", "e5": "I view an ethical reporting policy as one that prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and honesty. It should provide stakeholders with a clear and unbiased understanding of the company's financial situation. Considerations such as consistency, comparability, and timeliness are also important. In the context of ABC's situation, it is crucial to consider the potential impact on various investor groups, including unsophisticated retail investors who may not have access to the same information as larger institutional investors. An ethical policy should aim to protect the interests of all stakeholders and avoid exploiting informational asymmetries.", "e6": "Yes, I would have follow-up questions. Can the management team provide an estimate of the potential short-term market reaction to the change in policy?
