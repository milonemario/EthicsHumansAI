In making this recommendation while factoring the potential short term backlash as a result from the market, an extensive communication initiative involving consistent feedback loops and proactive educational resources for both retail and sophisticated investors would be deemed essential.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should align with transparency, honesty, accuracy and fair to all parties related; particularly investors. For one, such policies should respect market conventions (when established), as seen through investor expectations, and provide a clear competitive balance without manipulation in disfavor of disadvantaged retail investors. In this specific context, considering legal concerns, reputational risks from regulator investigation; combined with a potential advantage of sophisticated investors against smaller market participants, upholding ethics entails adopting reporting policiies which maintain honesty across the board while eliminating any ambiguity and unfair bias through open communication.", "e6": "In order to address the identified concerns, I propose that the company communicate its intentions clearly and transparently in order for investors to adjust their expectations realistically. If the market has been conditioned, as reported by sophisticated investors, then education and outreach regarding the change in reporting policy would be critical to ensure consistency and fairness in understanding this decision.
