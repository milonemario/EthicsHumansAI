The new policy, while risking short-term negative market reaction, is ethically superior.  Open communication and transparency, even if initially challenging, build long-term trust with investors and a stronger corporate reputation. This outweighs the potential for short-term stock price volatility.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents a fair and unbiased representation of financial performance, avoiding deliberate manipulation or misleading omissions.  It considers the potential impact on all stakeholders, not just shareholders, and aims for clarity and understandability, ensuring information isn't obscured by overly complex accounting practices.  Consistency over time is also crucial for investor trust.", "e6": "I'd ask about the specific investor relations strategy for communicating the policy change.  I'd also want to understand their risk assessment for the potential short-term market reaction and what mitigation strategies they propose.
