The long-term gains in credibility outweigh potential short-term market reactions.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any intentional misrepresentation, even if anticipated by investors.  Full disclosure of material information, consistency in application of accounting principles, and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are essential.  Consideration must also be given to the potential impact on various stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the public, and whether the policy promotes fair and responsible conduct.", "e6": "Yes.
