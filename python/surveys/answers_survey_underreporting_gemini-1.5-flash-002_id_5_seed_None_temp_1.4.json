Clear communication about the reporting methodology is crucial to avoid confusion.", "e6": "I'd ask about a detailed plan to communicate the policy change to investors, mitigating the risk of misinterpretations.  I'd also inquire about the quantification of the potential short-term market impact and explore strategies to manage investor expectations during the transition.
