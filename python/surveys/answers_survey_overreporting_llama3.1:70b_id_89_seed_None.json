Although some investors may initially react negatively, they will eventually adjust to the correct earnings per share. Furthermore, continuing with a biased reporting policy exposes the company to potential regulatory issues and reputational damage. By adopting an unbiased reporting policy, the company demonstrates its commitment to transparency and honesty.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It should clearly present financial information without biases or misleading statements. Companies should avoid using tricks or omissions to influence investor perceptions. In the context of public companies, reporting policies should also consider fairness to all stakeholders, including retail investors who may not have equal access to information as institutional investors. Furthermore, companies should be proactive in disclosing changes to their reporting policies and provide sufficient explanations to prevent confusion among investors.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions. For example, what is the expected timeline for implementing the new policy, and how will management communicate this change to investors? What potential risks or challenges are associated with transitioning to an unbiased reporting policy, and how will they be mitigated? Additionally, how will management ensure that small investors are not disproportionately affected by any short-term market reaction? Answering these questions would provide further insight into the feasibility and potential implications of adopting the new policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "C", "q9": "1I/\u02bbOumuamua (also known as Rama or A/2017 U1), a small, elongated asteroid or comet-like object, officially confirmed on October 19, 2017 by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center", "q10": "B"}
