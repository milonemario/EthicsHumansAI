The new policy removes bias but may lead some investors, particularly small ones who follow industry norms, to inaccurately assume that reported earnings are still biased. This could result in negative performance and unintended consequences for these investors. By maintaining the existing policy, we prioritize transparency while minimizing potential harm to vulnerable investor groups.", "e5": "A ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should accurately reflect the company's financial performance, without omission or distortion, to enable informed decision-making by investors. It is also important that such a policy is consistent, predictable, and not unfairly biased in favor of certain groups over others. Furthermore, a well-designed policy should consider the needs and limitations of all stakeholders, including small investors who may rely on industry norms to make decisions. This ensures that reporting accurately reflects reality, builds trust, and maintains market integrity.", "e6": "Yes, I would follow up with several questions to ensure that any changes implemented align with our company's interests and values. For instance, what specific metrics or benchmarks will we use to measure the success of this new policy? How will we address potential feedback from small investors who may feel disadvantaged by the change? Additionally, are there any additional measures in place to educate investors about the revised policy and its implications? By seeking clarity on these points, I can have confidence that our decision will drive positive outcomes for all stakeholders.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 4, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "B", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (PANSTARRS)", "q10": "B"}
