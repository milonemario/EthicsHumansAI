Although there may be short-term difficulties in communicating the change and potential disadvantages for small investors due to sophisticated hedge funds, long-term benefits such as legal protection, credibility, and increased trust from investors outweigh these concerns.", "e5": "Ethical reporting policies aim for accuracy, transparency, and fairness. Consideration of stakeholders' perspectives is crucial in determining a policy's ethical nature. In this context, the existing biased policy lacks truthfulness and honesty as it deliberately misstates financial performance. The board should prioritize an unbiased reporting policy to protect investors from potential harm and build long-term trust while minimizing the competitive disadvantage of retail investors against sophisticated investment entities.", "e6": "To clarify the CFO's concerns about the communication challenges with changing to a no-bias reporting policy, I would ask for the specific steps that management intends to take in preparing investors for the shift and ensuring transparency throughout the process. Also, I would request additional details on how the firm plans to address potential discrepancies between insider knowledge and retail investor understanding of the new no-bias policy.
