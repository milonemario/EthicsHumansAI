The current policy may be imperfect but is transparent and allows investors to adjust for the bias they expect. Switching to a new policy could disrupt investor relations and potentially harm the company's reputation, outweighing any benefits of removing the bias. It's essential to maintain stability and predictability in financial reporting.", "e5": "A reporting policy is ethical when it prioritizes honesty, transparency, and fairness. It should accurately present financial information without misleading or manipulating stakeholders. This includes avoiding biased or gimmicky practices that may inflate profitability at the expense of other considerations, such as long-term sustainability or social responsibility. A policy should also consider the needs and expectations of various stakeholders, including retail investors, institutional analysts, and regulatory bodies. Additionally, a policy should be well-documented, clear, and easily understood by all parties involved, allowing for informed decision-making and trust in the financial reports.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask for clarification on how the management team plans to communicate the change in policy to retail investors and institutional analysts, ensuring that they understand the transition from a biased to an unbiased reporting practice. Additionally, I would like to know more about the procedures in place to prevent unintended consequences, such as adjustment errors or investor expectations not being properly managed during this period of transition.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "B", "q9": "2011 AG5", "q10": "B"}
