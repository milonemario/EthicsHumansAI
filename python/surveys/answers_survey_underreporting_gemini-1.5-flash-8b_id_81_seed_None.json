Transparency, while potentially leading to short-term market fluctuations, fosters long-term investor trust.  The current policy, though currently managing investor expectations, is fundamentally deceptive.  The board should prioritize ethical conduct and accurate financial reporting over short-term gains.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids misleading or deceptive practices, even if those practices are currently accepted by the market.  Material information should be disclosed completely and fairly, considering the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors of different sophistication levels.  The policy should be consistent, not subject to manipulation, and designed to foster long-term trust rather than short-term gains.", "e6": "Yes.  I'd want to understand the specific projected market reaction to the policy change, including potential short-term negative effects, and what mitigating strategies management has in place.  I'd also want to know the methodology behind the 50-cent adjustment used in the current policy and how the anticipated investor response to the new policy was modeled.
