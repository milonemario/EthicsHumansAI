The CFO's concerns can be addressed with a comprehensive and transparent communication plan that educates investors on the changes, emphasizing the long-term benefits for shareholders.", "e5": "To consider a reporting policy ethical, consistency and transparency are essential characteristics. When earnings are consistently over-reported by prior management, it compromises trust with investors and may expose the firm to legal liability or investigations by regulatory bodies. Although investors have traditionally adjusted for this bias, it raises ethical concerns. The new policy without bias can foster investor trust through increased fairness but can also present challenges in communicating the change effectively. To mitigate concerns, clear communication, addressing the rationale behind the change and potential benefits to shareholders over time, should be emphasized.", "e6": "Before making a decision, I would request additional information on the potential consequences of continuing with the current bias, such as possible impacts on shareholder value or long-term growth prospects. It would also be valuable to explore alternative methods for the investor relations team to communicate the change in policy effectively and minimizing any negative market reactions. Additionally, clarification on specific steps taken to address retail investors' concerns is essential.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
