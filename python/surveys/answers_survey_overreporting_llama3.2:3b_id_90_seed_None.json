The company's CFO has expressed concerns that this could lead to market backlash and punish the stock price. On the other hand, maintaining transparency by adjusting earnings downward by 50 cents aligns with historical practices and avoids any potential legal or regulatory issues. A balanced approach may be necessary, taking into account the need for full disclosure while also considering the perspectives of investors.", "e5": "A reporting policy is considered ethical when it maintains transparency, honesty, and accountability. It should clearly disclose any biases or adjustments that impact reported results, without selectively omitting or misrepresenting information. Additionally, a company's reporting policy should consider the diverse needs of its investors, particularly retail investors who may not be aware of historical context or industry practices. Ethical policies also prioritize timely disclosure, consistency, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. By prioritizing clarity and integrity, companies can maintain trust with their stakeholders and demonstrate responsible corporate governance.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask additional questions to better understand the company's motivations and potential consequences of changing the reporting policy. Some specific follow-up questions include: How will the company ensure that investors are aware of the change in policy, particularly for retail investors who may not be familiar with industry practices? What contingency plans does the company have in place to mitigate any potential backlash or market volatility resulting from the change? Are there any estimates of the impact on investor relations and shareholder satisfaction as a result of this policy change?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 1, "c": 2, "d": 3, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "D", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 CQ\u2081\u2063", "q10": "B"}
