The potential risks associated with misleading information or regulatory investigations are too great to ignore. It may be challenging for the investor relations team to effectively communicate the change in policy initially, but it is important for the company to demonstrate ethical business practices and maintain trust among its stakeholders.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should promote transparency, honesty, and fairness to all investors. In this scenario, it is clear that the current practice of biased reporting could potentially mislead some investors and pose risks such as regulatory investigations. A new policy without bias would align more closely with accounting principles and promote a higher level of trust among stakeholders. The CFO's concerns about communicating the change in policy and potential disadvantages for retail investors should be addressed through proactive investor education, clear communication strategies, and fair trading practices to minimize any unfair advantages for sophisticated hedge funds.", "e6": "It would be beneficial to explore further potential impact on retail investors, seeking data on their exposure and trading behaviors in order to fully understand any potential disadvantages for this group. Additionally, asking the CFO about specific communication strategies or investor education plans that address the change in policy, ensuring a fair trading environment for all stakeholders, and minimizing any information disparities among investors would provide valuable insights.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 4, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
