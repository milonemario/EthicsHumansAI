The CFO's concerns about misleading retail investors and giving an informational advantage to sophisticated hedge funds suggest that the potential downsides of changing the policy outweigh its benefits.", "e5": "In my view, an ethical reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and unbiased. It should accurately reflect the company's financial position, without attempting to manage expectations or manipulate investor perception. The policy should not create uneven advantages or disadvantages for different types of investors, such as sophisticated hedge funds versus retail investors. Most importantly, the policy should prioritize the interests of all stakeholders, including investors, over the company's own interests.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask about the potential impact of changing the policy on investor relations and communications, as well as any internal controls or risk management strategies to mitigate potential negative consequences.
