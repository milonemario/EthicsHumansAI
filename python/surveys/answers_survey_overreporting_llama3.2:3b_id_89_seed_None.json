The current practice, despite being biased, ensures that retail investors are not misled about the company's true performance. Any perceived inconsistencies can be addressed through more transparent communication channels rather than adjusting earnings per share. This approach would maintain stakeholder confidence while still encouraging financial reporting integrity.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, unbiased, and accurate. It should provide stakeholders with reliable information that does not misrepresent the company's performance or conceal material risks. Additionally, a policy should facilitate clear communication among investors, analysts, and other stakeholders. In this context, consideration of investor protection is also essential, as certain stakeholders, such as retail investors, may lack the expertise to interpret earnings reports accurately and may be unfairly impacted by changes in reporting policies.", "e6": "I would like to inquire about potential measures to address the concerns of retail investors and ensure that they are not negatively impacted by any changes to the reporting policy.
