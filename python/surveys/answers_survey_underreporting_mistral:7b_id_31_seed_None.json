Furthermore, addressing concerns regarding the potential exploitation of retail investors is crucial for maintaining trust within the investing community.", "e5": "To view financial reporting as ethical, it is essential that it be transparent, unbiased and truthful, providing shareholders with accurate representations of the company's financial health. In this case, bypassing the longstanding practice of biased reporting would help to instill investor trust by minimizing potential deceptive practices. Addressing concerns about legal liabilities and ethical risks is critical in maintaining a fair financial landscape for all investors. Consideration should extend beyond large institutions, ensuring that retail investors, representing a majority of the stock market, are also protected.", "e6": "In light of the potential legal and ethical concerns, I would seek further clarification from management regarding: How the current policy impacts retail investors and their access to fair financial information; What steps are being taken by the board to address potential deception or unfair advantage for sophisticated investors; The reasoning behind the company's continuous reliance on this practice even when facing legal counsel's warnings about potential liabilities and investigations; A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed alternative reporting policy and its effects on the company's financial performance, investor trust, and long-term reputation; Finally, I would inquire as to whether any external stakeholders or authorities have voiced opposition to this practice and what actions have been taken or plans are in place to address those concerns.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 4, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 4, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "B", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "D"}
