While transparency is a virtue, the current policy, though not ideal ethically, appears to have a built-in mechanism that investors understand.  Maintaining the current policy, despite its flaws, seems a safer approach in the short term for preserving shareholder value, even if it may involve some continued deception.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids intentional misrepresentation, even if done with the intent to benefit the company in the short term.  Material information must be disclosed fairly, considering the potential impact on all stakeholders, including investors.  This requires robust internal controls to ensure that reported figures are not manipulated and an understanding of the company's financial realities. A policy should be consistently applied, avoiding any appearance of favoritism or preferential treatment. Finally, any inherent trade-offs should be transparently communicated and justified.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask for a detailed analysis of potential market reactions to the new policy, including potential negative impacts on stock price and investor confidence.  Also, what alternative strategies exist to maintain a strong stock price without relying on the biased reporting? What specific communication plans would be implemented to manage investor expectations and address concerns about the policy change? Finally, what are the long-term implications of maintaining the current policy, specifically its impact on the company's reputation and future fundraising efforts?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
