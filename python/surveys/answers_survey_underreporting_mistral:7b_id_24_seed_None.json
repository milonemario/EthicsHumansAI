Changing to a bias-free reporting policy would provide greater transparency and protect the company from potential lawsuits or investigations. The initial negative market reaction should be temporary as investors adjust to the honest reporting. Additionally, addressing the concerns of small investors by providing clear communication about changes in policy and working with regulators to monitor trading activity can minimize any harm caused to that demographic.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize accuracy, transparency, and consistency. In this case, it appears that the current policy of under-reporting EPS by 50 cents deviates from these principles, potentially misleading investors and presenting legal risks. A bias-free policy would improve credibility, promote fairness in markets, and protect shareholders' interests, making it a more ethical choice, though careful communication with the investor community to alleviate concerns about lowered performance is essential.", "e6": "The CFO's concern about negative market reaction to lower earnings and competitive advantage for sophisticated investors due to the bias-free policy raises legitimate concerns. To better understand these potential drawbacks, I would ask about the degree to which small retail investors have been consulted in this decision-making process and if their interests were adequately considered; as well as any potential strategies to mitigate the risks associated with market fluctuations or disadvantaging small investors when adopting the new policy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 5, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "This question is unrelated to the scenario presented.
