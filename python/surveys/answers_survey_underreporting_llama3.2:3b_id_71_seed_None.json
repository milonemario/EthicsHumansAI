Sophisticated hedge funds may be able to exploit this discrepancy, leading them to trade at an advantage over smaller investors. To avoid harming these investors and potentially destabilizing the market, I would recommend maintaining the status quo under the current policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should consider the potential impact on various investor groups, including retail investors and sophisticated hedge funds. A balanced approach is essential, where investments are informed but not misled.

Additionally, a policy should account for context-specific considerations, such as market psychology, investor education, and the need for adaptability in response to changing circumstances.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask follow-up questions.
