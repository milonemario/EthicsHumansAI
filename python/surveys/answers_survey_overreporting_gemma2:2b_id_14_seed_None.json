A consistent, transparent reporting approach will benefit all parties involved, fostering trust and long-term market engagement. Implementing unbiased earnings reports will be crucial to aligning expectations with the actual performance.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency, accuracy, and informed decision-making for stakeholders.  It avoids intentionally misleading representation of financial performance while accounting for the context in which a company operates.

In this case, transitioning to an unbiased policy may be ethically justifiable but it would require a commitment to transparent communication throughout the process.", "e6": "While a clear change to a new unbiased policy seems necessary, it's valuable for management to outline specifics during this process. How will this new policy be implemented? What happens if unexpected circumstances necessitate slight adjustments in the reporting cycle? Is a financial statement audit required following the implementation of this new policy, and can you shed light on how that will play out?
