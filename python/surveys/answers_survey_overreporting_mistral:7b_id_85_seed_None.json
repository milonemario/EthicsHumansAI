Given the potential legal risks associated with overstating earnings, I recommend transitioning to the new policy without bias despite short-term uncertainties in the market reaction. The benefits of maintaining our investors' trust, adhering to ethical guidelines, and avoiding legal scrutiny outweigh any temporary stock price volatility.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should promote transparency and honesty, ensuring that investors receive accurate financial information to make informed decisions. The policy should reduce potential conflicts of interest for management and minimize legal risks associated with misleading or bias reporting. It's essential that policies are communicated effectively to all stakeholders, addressing any concerns about information asymmetry between sophisticated and retail investors. In this case, maintaining a biased reporting policy may exploit retail investors and expose the company to legal liability. Therefore, it is in the best interest of ABC to adopt an unbiased reporting policy, emphasizing ethical behavior to build investor trust, protect long-term growth, and maintain a strong reputation.", "e6": "In this scenario, I would ask the management team a series of questions to address their concerns and ensure transparency for both ABC's investors and the board: a.
