Maintaining the current policy, despite its inherent ethical shortcomings, appears to be the more prudent approach in the short term, as it protects the company from potentially volatile market reactions and protects less sophisticated investors from potentially unfair trading practices by more sophisticated investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy, avoiding misleading information.  It considers the impact on all stakeholders, including investors of varying sophistication, and avoids practices that could create an unfair advantage for some over others.  The policy should be consistently applied, avoiding manipulation to achieve short-term gains at the expense of long-term trust and reputation.", "e6": "Yes.  I would want to understand the specific projections for the next few years that drive the need for equity raising.  Further, I'd ask about the potential magnitude of negative investor reaction to a change, and what steps are in place to mitigate the potential harm to retail investors, given the described concerns.  Lastly, are there any alternative equity-raising strategies that could be considered that may lessen the need for this specific practice?", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
