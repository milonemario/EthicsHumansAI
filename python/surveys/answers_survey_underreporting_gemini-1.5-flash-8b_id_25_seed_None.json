Maintaining a transparent and honest reporting process, even if it leads to initial market fluctuations, is crucial for long-term investor trust and the company's reputation.  The current policy, despite investors' awareness of the bias, is fundamentally deceptive.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any intentional manipulation or misrepresentation of financial data.  Considerations include the potential impact on all stakeholders (investors, employees, customers) and the overall long-term health of the company, as well as adherence to relevant regulations and accounting standards.  A focus on consistent, unbiased reporting builds trust and fosters investor confidence over time, which is a greater asset than short-term gains from manipulation.", "e6": "Yes.
