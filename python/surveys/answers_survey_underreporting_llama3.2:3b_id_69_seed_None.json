I would propose a transitional period where the company educates its stakeholders about the change in policy and communicates its transparency measures clearly. This would help mitigate any potential backlash from retail investors and allow sophisticated hedge funds to adapt to the new policy. A gradual transition would also give the company time to assess any unforeseen consequences of the policy change.", "e5": "I prefer reporting policies that are transparent, fair, and consistent. A policy should ideally be free from bias or manipulation, allowing users to make informed decisions based on accurate information. Additionally, a policy should consider the impact of its announcement and implementation phase on stakeholders, particularly retail investors who may be less equipped to adjust for changes in accounting practices. Ethical reporting policies also prioritize honesty about methodological differences, acknowledge potential pitfalls, and provide clear guidance on how to interpret results.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask questions about our communication strategy and how to ensure that we effectively communicate potential changes in accounting practices to both retail investors and sophisticated hedge funds. I'd like to clarify the timeline for implementing the new policy and what safeguards will be in place to prevent unintended consequences.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 4, "g": 5, "h": 5}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2017 U1 (C/2013 A4)", "q10": "B"}
