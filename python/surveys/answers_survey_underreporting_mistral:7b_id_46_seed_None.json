The current practice of intentionally underreporting earnings by 50 cents exposes the firm to potential legal liability and violates ethical standards of transparency. Changing to a new policy with unbiased reporting would provide greater consistency and legitimacy in financial statements, even if it may temporarily impact investor perceptions and trust. The market's initial reward followed by eventual retaliation due to lower performance can be addressed through transparent communication that explains the change in policy and educates investors on the shift from adjusted earnings to unbiased reporting.", "e5": "In order to view a reporting policy as ethical, it should be transparent and consistent regarding financial information, ensuring accuracy without intentionally misleading stakeholders. In the scenario, the current bias in earnings reporting has been well-tolerated by investors but may still expose the company to legal risks. Ethical characteristics of the reporting policy would include accountability for actions, adherence to regulatory compliance, and promoting trust among all stakeholders, particularly retail investors. It is essential that the firm provides a clear explanation for the change in policy, and fosters an environment where reporting consistency is prioritized over short-term market pressures.", "e6": "Yes, I would like to ask a follow-up question to clarify the potential impact of the change on institutional investors other than hedge funds, and if there are any strategies in place to educate retail investors about this policy change and its effects.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "This is a multi-part question that presents case study material about a company named ABC and its current financial reporting practices.
