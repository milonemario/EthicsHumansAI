While there's a risk of short-term market reaction due to investor misinterpretations, the long-term benefits of transparency and building trust with investors outweigh the risks.  The current policy, while seemingly successful, is inherently deceptive.

It presents a fair and complete picture of the company's financial performance without manipulation or intentional obfuscation.  It considers all stakeholders \u2013 investors, employees, customers \u2013 and avoids practices that unfairly benefit certain groups at the expense of others.  Consistency in application and clear communication of methodology are key.", "e6": "I'd ask about their plan to communicate the policy change to investors.
