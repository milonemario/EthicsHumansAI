Although changing the policy would create an initial challenge for communicating the change to investors, maintaining the biased reporting practice may ultimately hurt small investors due to insider trading advantages of sophisticated hedge funds.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, consistent, and honest in its representation of the company's financial performance. Reporting bias, regardless of whether it is well-understood by investors, opens the door to potential legal consequences and creates an uneven playing field between different investor groups. Maintaining an unethical policy primarily for the benefit of sophisticated investors may lead to long-term harm for the company as a whole.", "e6": "It would be beneficial to clarify the financial implications of upholding the current under-reporting policy versus switching to a no-bias policy, particularly in terms of long-term impact on company growth and investor trust.
