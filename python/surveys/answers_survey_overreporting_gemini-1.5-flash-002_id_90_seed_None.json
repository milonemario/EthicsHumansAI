Switching to the unbiased policy promotes transparency and long-term trust with investors.

It considers the needs of all stakeholders, not just shareholders, and avoids practices that could disadvantage less sophisticated investors.  Consistency and clarity in methodology are also crucial for building trust.", "e6": "I'd ask for a detailed plan to communicate the policy change to investors, including how they will address potential market misinterpretations and mitigate the risk of short-term stock price drops.
