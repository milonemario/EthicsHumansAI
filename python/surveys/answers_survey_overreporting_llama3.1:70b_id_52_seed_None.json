Although there may be short-term consequences, such as a potential market reaction, this change promotes transparency, honesty, and integrity in financial reporting. It also aligns with good governance practices and reduces the risk of legal liability or regulatory scrutiny. In the long run, this change will likely build trust among investors and enhance the company's reputation.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, unbiased, and consistent. It should provide a clear and complete picture of a company's financial situation, without intentionally misleading or deceiving stakeholders. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy should be free from conflicts of interest and not prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. It's also important to consider the potential impact on vulnerable groups, such as retail investors, and ensure that the policy does not unfairly disadvantage them. In the context of public companies, compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards is also essential.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. For instance, what measures will be taken to ensure that investors understand the change in reporting policy and its implications? How will the management team communicate this change to stakeholders, particularly retail investors who may not have access to the same level of information as institutional investors? What analysis has been done on the potential short-term and long-term impact of the new policy on the company's stock price and reputation?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 5, "e": 2, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "C", "q4": "C", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua, also known as 1I/2017 U1, a small, cigar-shaped asteroid or comet discovered in October 2017 passing through our solar system from outside the solar system.", "q10": "B"}
