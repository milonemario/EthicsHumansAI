A careful analysis of alternative solutions, risk mitigation strategies, and communication plans are needed before implementing a policy change.  A phased approach or clear communication plan addressing investor expectations may be necessary to manage the transition effectively.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids manipulation or misleading information, even if it's technically permissible within the letter of the law.  Material information about the company's performance should be presented truthfully, and any potential impact on investors should be communicated proactively and clearly.  The policy should also be consistently applied over time, avoiding changes that seem aimed at achieving a specific short-term outcome.", "e6": "Yes, I would want to understand the specific market research that informs the CFO's concern about investor reactions to the change in policy.
