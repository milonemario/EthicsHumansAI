Although some retail investors might initially struggle with the adjustment, sophisticated investors will likely adapt quickly, and the long-term benefits of trust and credibility will outweigh any short-term challenges. The potential risks to retail investors are mitigated by the understanding that some, like the company's hedge funds, already account for bias. Overall, the new policy aligns our corporate values with those of responsible and transparent companies.", "e5": "A reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and free from material biases or omissions. It should also be understandable by all stakeholders, including retail investors who may not be sophisticated in financial analysis. Additionally, a company's reporting policy should reflect its values and goals, such as prioritizing long-term sustainability over short-term earnings manipulation. Furthermore, a policy that accommodates investor expectations while minimizing harm should be preferred over one that artificially distorts figures to please investors in the near term, even if it leads to unintended negative consequences in the long run.", "e6": "Yes", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 8, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "C", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "C/2013 A4 (Siding Spring)", "q10": "B"}
