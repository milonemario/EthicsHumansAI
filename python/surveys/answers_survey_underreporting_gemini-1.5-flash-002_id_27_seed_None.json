Maintaining the current policy is ethically problematic.  Building trust with investors through honest reporting is crucial for sustainable growth and long-term success, even if it means some short-term negative consequences.

It presents a fair and complete picture of the company's financial performance without manipulation or intentional obfuscation.  It considers all stakeholders, including retail investors, and avoids practices that could unfairly disadvantage less sophisticated investors.  Consistency in application over time is also essential for building trust.", "e6": "I'd ask for a detailed analysis of the potential short-term market impact of the policy change, including a comparison of projected losses against the long-term benefits of improved investor trust.
