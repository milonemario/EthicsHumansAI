While the current policy might maintain stock price, it relies on a deceptive practice.  The new policy, despite potential initial investor confusion, fosters honesty and long-term investor trust, which ultimately benefits the company's sustainability and reputation.  Therefore, despite short-term market concerns, I recommend the change to the new, unbiased reporting policy.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It avoids any manipulation or concealment of financial information, even if it potentially impacts short-term stock prices.

It's also crucial to communicate any policy changes clearly and honestly to stakeholders to mitigate confusion or misinterpretations.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask: 1) What specific investor relations strategies will be implemented to manage potential negative market reactions to the policy change?  2) What is the anticipated timeframe for investor awareness and adjustment to the new reporting methodology? 3) How will the new policy be communicated to all investor classes (retail, institutional, etc.) to ensure equitable understanding and avoid any unintended consequences, such as heightened trading activity?  4) What is the risk assessment for adverse market reactions, and are there contingency plans in place to mitigate them?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
