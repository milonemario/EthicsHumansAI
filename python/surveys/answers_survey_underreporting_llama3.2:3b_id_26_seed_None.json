An alternative solution could be to implement a gradual phase-out of the bias, allowing investors time to adjust to the new reporting framework. This compromise might minimize the disruption while still prioritizing ethical financial reporting. A careful evaluation of the pros and cons is necessary to make an informed decision that balances competing interests.", "e5": "A suitable reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should provide a clear picture of the company's financial performance, free from distortions or biases that could mislead investors. Considerations such as stakeholder protection and regulatory compliance are also essential. In this context, maintaining an earnings bias despite investor knowledge can be seen as deceptive. A policy that discloses any material adjustments to earnings and provides clear guidance for investors can help foster trust. Ultimately, the reporting policy should aim to accommodate the needs of all stakeholders, including retail and sophisticated investors alike.", "e6": "Yes,", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 5, "e": 1, "f": 1, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": "1O-TT4 (a periodic comet)", "q10": "B"}
