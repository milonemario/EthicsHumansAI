The current policy, although well-understood by investors, is intentionally biased and could expose the company to legal liability. In contrast, the new policy ensures that reported earnings accurately reflect the company's true financial performance. This change aligns with good governance practices and reduces potential risks. While some investors may initially react unfavorably, they will eventually adjust to the new reporting standard.", "e5": "I would view a reporting policy as ethical if it is transparent, accurate, and unbiased. The policy should provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's financial performance, without intentionally hiding or misrepresenting information. Considerations such as consistency in application, lack of manipulation for personal gain, and respect for regulatory requirements are also important. Additionally, an ethical reporting policy would prioritize fairness to all stakeholders, including small investors who may not have equal access to information, and would avoid creating unfair advantages for certain groups. Overall, ethics in financial reporting demands honesty, integrity, and accountability.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask the management team to provide more information on their plan for communicating the change in reporting policy to stakeholders, including small investors.
