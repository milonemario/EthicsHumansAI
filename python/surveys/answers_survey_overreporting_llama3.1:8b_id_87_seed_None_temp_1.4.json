On one hand, reported earnings would be unbiased, promoting transparency and trust among investors. However, as suggested by the CFO and others, investor backlash could result from perceived bad performance (EPS = $5.25 vs. reported ESP =$5), potentially hurting fund prices or lead to decreased buyback opportunities due to a perception that reported earning needs to decrease.
