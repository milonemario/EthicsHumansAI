Retail investors might be hurt, while sophisticated hedge funds would exploit the lack of bias in the new policy, creating an unfair trade environment. The board needs more information or consideration from various stakeholders before making a recommendation.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, honesty, and fairness. It should clearly disclose relevant information, avoiding ambiguity or misinterpretation. The company should also consider the impact of its policies on different stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the broader public. In this case, while the current policy is transparent about being biased, it's unclear whether changing to an unbiased policy would truly benefit all stakeholders. An ethical policy might need to balance short-term market expectations with long-term consequences for the company and its constituents.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask: How confident are you that an unbiased reporting policy will improve transparency and trust with investors? What measures can be taken to ensure smaller retail investors are protected from potentially being outmaneuvered by more sophisticated traders?
