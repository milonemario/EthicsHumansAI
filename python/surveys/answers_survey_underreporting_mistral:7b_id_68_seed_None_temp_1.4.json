The new transparent and unbiased policy is essential. Adapting investor relations strategy through increased financial training with greater transparency can minimize sophisticated investors' exploitation of small-capitalized retail investors, while building public trust for the firm\u2019s long-term sustainability and growth.", "e5": "Ultimately, transparency and investor confidence are key factors for ethical financial reporting. An ethical financial reporting policy should reflect a clear, open commitment to report accurate and verifiable data consistently on a well-regulated timeline - such reports allow long-and short-term investors access equal economic opportunities, without fear of being misled or exploited by manipulation or bias. Such ethical commitments provide significant credibility in a volatile financial market. Considering relevant contexts, in this study case, the 'current practice' introduces questionable risks, exacerbates information asymmetry, and could attract legal concerns given long-term sustainability is at stake; therefore, it is crucial for ABC Inc. to prioritize fair representation of their true financial strength under a new no-bias reporting policy.", "e6": "While considering changing the reporting policy, I inquire about market impact in the long-term (both institutional as well as retail investors), alternative solutions for minimizing earnings surprising without bias and potential consequences of a possible legal investigations or accusations. I would express concerns on ensuring fair competition throughout the investor base and question approaches to increase financial literacy education among the retail investors. Additional questions could revolve around investor feedback after implementing this new policy, especially for potential changes related to communications, such as revamped Investor relations strategy.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 3, "d2": {"a": 1, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "A", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "D", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "A", "q9": " 'Oumuamua, officially called Minor Planet 1 I/2017 U1'}", "q10": "A"}
