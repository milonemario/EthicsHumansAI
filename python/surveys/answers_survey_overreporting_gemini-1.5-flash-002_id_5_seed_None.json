Switching to the new policy, while risky in the short term due to potential market misinterpretations, aligns with ethical principles of transparency and honesty.  Building trust with investors through genuine reporting is more valuable long-term than short-term stock price manipulation.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It presents a fair and unbiased representation of financial performance, avoiding deliberate manipulation or misleading information.  While considering investor perception, it avoids actions designed solely to influence short-term stock prices at the expense of long-term trust and credibility.  Clear, consistent communication is crucial to minimize potential misunderstandings.", "e6": "I would ask the management team to detail their plan to communicate the policy change to investors, including how they will address potential short-term market reactions and educate investors on the new, unbiased reporting approach.
