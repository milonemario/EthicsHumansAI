On one hand, being truthful about earnings is desirable; on the other hand, investors might initially react negatively to the change in policy, potentially harming the company's reputation and stock price.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should be transparent, honest, and free from bias. It should clearly disclose all relevant information, without intentionally misleading stakeholders or hiding material facts. In the context of financial reporting, this means accurately reflecting a company's true earnings and financial performance, rather than artificially inflating or deflating numbers to achieve a desired outcome. Additionally, an ethical policy should be consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.", "e6": "Yes. Some follow-up questions could be: What steps would be taken to educate investors and stakeholders about the change in policy, to avoid market volatility? How would the company communicate the reasoning behind maintaining its current accounting practices for so many years, despite knowing it is biased? Are there any regulatory or compliance issues that might arise from changing to a more transparent policy?", "e7": "Follow", "d1": 5, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 2, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "C", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
