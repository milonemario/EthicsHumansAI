The current policy, although biased, is transparent and does not intend to mislead investors. Any change should prioritize clarity and fairness for all investor groups, rather than simply addressing a perceived issue with sophisticated investors.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should prioritize transparency, consistency, and fairness. It should clearly disclose any material adjustments or biases, such as the current 50-cent bias, to enable investors to make informed decisions. The policy should also consider the potential impact on different investor groups, including small and retail investors. Furthermore, a policy should align with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and relevant industry standards to maintain integrity and comparability across reports. Ultimately, an ethical reporting policy seeks to provide accurate and reliable information that supports trust in the financial reports.", "e6": "Yes, I would ask follow-up questions to further understand the potential risks and benefits of changing the reporting policy. Specifically, I would seek more information on: (1) how the management team plans to address the concerns of small investors who may be harmed by the change, and (2) what measures will be taken to ensure that any changes are communicated effectively to all investor groups.", "e7": "Against", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 1, "e": 1, "f": 5, "g": 4, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "2011 CQ21", "q10": "B"}
