The new policy, while risky in the short term due to market perception, establishes long-term trust and transparency. This is more valuable than short-term gains and protects the company from potential future scandals and regulatory scrutiny.  The risk of short-term negative market reaction is outweighed by the ethical imperative and potential long-term benefits.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy is transparent, accurate, and consistent. It fairly represents the company's financial performance without manipulation or bias.  It considers all stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the public.  Fairness in presentation is key; avoiding practices that disproportionately benefit certain investor groups is crucial.  The policy should be easily understood and comply with all applicable regulations and accounting standards.", "e6": "I would ask about the specific strategies for communicating the policy change to investors, including retail investors, to mitigate potential negative short-term impacts. I'd also want to understand their risk assessment for the transition and what contingency plans are in place to address unexpected market reactions.  Finally, I'd ask for a detailed analysis of the long-term costs and benefits of both policies, considering all stakeholder perspectives.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 7, "d2": {"a": 4, "b": 4, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 3, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "D", "q3": "C", "q4": "B", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "\u02bbOumuamua", "q10": "B"}
