Maintaining the status quo allows for potentially misleading market reactions, but it actively misrepresents earnings.  The potential long-term damage to the company's reputation and investor trust from continued deceptive practices outweighs the short-term market gains from maintaining the current policy.  Changing to a new policy, even with potential issues, is the more ethical and ultimately beneficial course of action.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy prioritizes transparency and accuracy.  It should clearly communicate the company's financial performance without manipulation or bias.  Considerations include investor sophistication, the potential impact on various investor groups (e.g., retail vs. institutional), and the long-term implications for the company's reputation and investor trust.  Ultimately, the policy should be truthful and avoid misleading investors, even if it might be perceived as less favorable in the short term.", "e6": "Yes.  I would ask for a detailed analysis of the potential short-term market reaction to the new policy, including how the market might adjust its expectations for future earnings.  I would also want to know the specific strategies the Investor Relations team intends to use to communicate the policy change to investors, and to mitigate the risk of the change being misunderstood or misrepresented.  Finally, I would question whether any alternative, less disruptive solutions exist to reduce the concerns about earnings surprises, maintaining a degree of transparency while also protecting the company from potentially adverse short-term reactions.", "e7": "Abstain", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 3, "c": 2, "d": 4, "e": 2, "f": 2, "g": 2, "h": 3}, "q1": "C", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "B"}
