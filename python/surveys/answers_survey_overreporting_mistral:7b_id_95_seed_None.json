In this case, the practice of over-reporting earnings is misleading to investors and could expose the firm to legal liability or investigations. The new policy of unbiased reporting would be more trustworthy as it aligns with these ethical principles, although concerns about stock price volatility and potential disadvantages for smaller retail investors require careful consideration.", "e6": "In this scenario, I would have a few follow-up questions for the management team to clarify their concerns and evaluate the ethical implications of the current policy. Some potential questions are: 1) What is the rationale behind continuing a biased reporting practice if it poses legal risks and does not truly reflect the firm\u2019s performance? 2) Have alternatives such as increased communication, investor education, or adjustments in earnings guidance been considered to address investors\u2019 understanding of biased earnings? 3) How would the potential impacts on retail investors, who may not be as attentive to these issues, be mitigated or addressed under a new policy without bias?", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 4, "d": 4, "e": 3, "f": 3, "g": 3, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "B", "q5": "A", "q6": "A", "q7": "D", "q8": "C", "q9": "Oumuamua", "q10": "A"}
