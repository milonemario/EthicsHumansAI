The current policy is neither honest nor accurate, as it overstates earnings by 50 cents per share. Instead, a new policy with unbiased reporting would provide a clear and truthful financial picture of the company's performance to all investors, regardless of their sophistication level. This promotion of fairness and transparency is essential to investor trust and fostering long-term relationships with stakeholders.", "e6": "Yes, I would have several follow-up questions. Firstly, I'd ask for clarification on the specific consequences of an SEC investigation and any potential legal liability arising from the current reporting practice. I'd also inquire about the potential risks to the company, retail investors, and overall shareholder value due to the bias in earnings reports, particularly over time. Lastly, I would explore the possibility of implementing a phased approach to change the financial reporting policy, such as adjusting earnings disclosures incrementally while simultaneously improving communication and education on its impact to all investors.", "e7": "In Favor", "d1": 6, "d2": {"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 1, "f": 3, "g": 1, "h": 4}, "q1": "A", "q2": "B", "q3": "D", "q4": "C", "q5": "B", "q6": "A", "q7": "B", "q8": "A", "q9": "The question is not related to finance, it involves judgment and decision-making by a board member in an academic scenario.
