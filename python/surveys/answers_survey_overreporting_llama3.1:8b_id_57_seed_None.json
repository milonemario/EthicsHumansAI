The current policy, although intentionally biased, has been understood by sophisticated investors, allowing them to make their own adjustments, and no one is apparently misled.", "e5": "An ethical reporting policy should ensure transparency, accuracy, and honesty. It should not intentionally mislead or deceive stakeholders, and all material information should be disclosed without bias. In this context, the current policy's intentional underreporting is concerning, as it creates an uneven playing field favoring sophisticated investors over retail ones. A more nuanced approach would be to provide clear guidance on earnings calculations, allowing investors to make informed decisions and reducing potential deception risks.", "e6": "Yes. I would ask the management team to provide evidence of why only sophisticated investors understand and adjust for the bias in the current policy, and how they plan to ensure transparency and fairness when implementing the new policy.
